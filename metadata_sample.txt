1|Calculation of prompt diphoton production cross sections at Tevatron and   LHC energies|C. Bal\'azs, E. L. Berger, P. M. Nadolsky, C.-P. Yuan|A fully differential calculation in perturbative quantum chromodynamics is presented for the production of massive photon pairs at hadron colliders. All next-to-leading order perturbative contributions from quark-antiquark, gluon-(anti)quark, and gluon-gluon subprocesses are included, as well as all-orders resummation of initial-state gluon radiation valid at next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy. The region of phase space is specified in which the calculation is most reliable. Good agreement is demonstrated with data from the Fermilab Tevatron, and predictions are made for more detailed tests with CDF and DO data. Predictions are shown for distributions of diphoton pairs produced at the energy of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Distributions of the diphoton pairs from the decay of a Higgs boson are contrasted with those produced from QCD processes at the LHC, showing that enhanced sensitivity to the signal can be obtained with judicious selection of events.
2|Sparsity-certifying Graph Decompositions|Ileana Streinu and Louis Theran|We describe a new algorithm, the $(k,\ell)$-pebble game with colors, and use it obtain a characterization of the family of $(k,\ell)$-sparse graphs and algorithmic solutions to a family of problems concerning tree decompositions of graphs. Special instances of sparse graphs appear in rigidity theory and have received increased attention in recent years. In particular, our colored pebbles generalize and strengthen the previous results of Lee and Streinu and give a new proof of the Tutte-Nash-Williams characterization of arboricity. We also present a new decomposition that certifies sparsity based on the $(k,\ell)$-pebble game with colors. Our work also exposes connections between pebble game algorithms and previous sparse graph algorithms by Gabow, Gabow and Westermann and Hendrickson.
3|The evolution of the Earth-Moon system based on the dark matter field   fluid model|Hongjun Pan|The evolution of Earth-Moon system is described by the dark matter field fluid model proposed in the Meeting of Division of Particle and Field 2004, American Physical Society. The current behavior of the Earth-Moon system agrees with this model very well and the general pattern of the evolution of the Moon-Earth system described by this model agrees with geological and fossil evidence. The closest distance of the Moon to Earth was about 259000 km at 4.5 billion years ago, which is far beyond the Roche's limit. The result suggests that the tidal friction may not be the primary cause for the evolution of the Earth-Moon system. The average dark matter field fluid constant derived from Earth-Moon system data is 4.39 x 10^(-22) s^(-1)m^(-1). This model predicts that the Mars's rotation is also slowing with the angular acceleration rate about -4.38 x 10^(-22) rad s^(-2).
4|A determinant of Stirling cycle numbers counts unlabeled acyclic   single-source automata|David Callan|We show that a determinant of Stirling cycle numbers counts unlabeled acyclic single-source automata. The proof involves a bijection from these automata to certain marked lattice paths and a sign-reversing involution to evaluate the determinant.
5|From dyadic $\Lambda_{\alpha}$ to $\Lambda_{\alpha}$|Wael Abu-Shammala and Alberto Torchinsky|In this paper we show how to compute the $\Lambda_{\alpha}$ norm, $\alpha\ge 0$, using the dyadic grid. This result is a consequence of the description of the Hardy spaces $H^p(R^N)$ in terms of dyadic and special atoms.
6|Bosonic characters of atomic Cooper pairs across resonance|Y. H. Pong and C. K. Law|We study the two-particle wave function of paired atoms in a Fermi gas with tunable interaction strengths controlled by Feshbach resonance. The Cooper pair wave function is examined for its bosonic characters, which is quantified by the correction of Bose enhancement factor associated with the creation and annihilation composite particle operators. An example is given for a three-dimensional uniform gas. Two definitions of Cooper pair wave function are examined. One of which is chosen to reflect the off-diagonal long range order (ODLRO). Another one corresponds to a pair projection of a BCS state. On the side with negative scattering length, we found that paired atoms described by ODLRO are more bosonic than the pair projected definition. It is also found that at $(k_F a)^{-1} \ge 1$, both definitions give similar results, where more than 90% of the atoms occupy the corresponding molecular condensates.
7|Polymer Quantum Mechanics and its Continuum Limit|Alejandro Corichi, Tatjana Vukasinac and Jose A. Zapata|A rather non-standard quantum representation of the canonical commutation relations of quantum mechanics systems, known as the polymer representation has gained some attention in recent years, due to its possible relation with Planck scale physics. In particular, this approach has been followed in a symmetric sector of loop quantum gravity known as loop quantum cosmology. Here we explore different aspects of the relation between the ordinary Schroedinger theory and the polymer description. The paper has two parts. In the first one, we derive the polymer quantum mechanics starting from the ordinary Schroedinger theory and show that the polymer description arises as an appropriate limit. In the second part we consider the continuum limit of this theory, namely, the reverse process in which one starts from the discrete theory and tries to recover back the ordinary Schroedinger quantum mechanics. We consider several examples of interest, including the harmonic oscillator, the free particle and a simple cosmological model.
8|Numerical solution of shock and ramp compression for general material   properties|Damian C. Swift|A general formulation was developed to represent material models for applications in dynamic loading. Numerical methods were devised to calculate response to shock and ramp compression, and ramp decompression, generalizing previous solutions for scalar equations of state. The numerical methods were found to be flexible and robust, and matched analytic results to a high accuracy. The basic ramp and shock solution methods were coupled to solve for composite deformation paths, such as shock-induced impacts, and shock interactions with a planar interface between different materials. These calculations capture much of the physics of typical material dynamics experiments, without requiring spatially-resolving simulations. Example calculations were made of loading histories in metals, illustrating the effects of plastic work on the temperatures induced in quasi-isentropic and shock-release experiments, and the effect of a phase transition.
9|The Spitzer c2d Survey of Large, Nearby, Insterstellar Clouds. IX. The   Serpens YSO Population As Observed With IRAC and MIPS|Paul Harvey, Bruno Merin, Tracy L. Huard, Luisa M. Rebull, Nicholas   Chapman, Neal J. Evans II, Philip C. Myers|We discuss the results from the combined IRAC and MIPS c2d Spitzer Legacy observations of the Serpens star-forming region. In particular we present a set of criteria for isolating bona fide young stellar objects, YSO's, from the extensive background contamination by extra-galactic objects. We then discuss the properties of the resulting high confidence set of YSO's. We find 235 such objects in the 0.85 deg^2 field that was covered with both IRAC and MIPS. An additional set of 51 lower confidence YSO's outside this area is identified from the MIPS data combined with 2MASS photometry. We describe two sets of results, color-color diagrams to compare our observed source properties with those of theoretical models for star/disk/envelope systems and our own modeling of the subset of our objects that appear to be star+disks. These objects exhibit a very wide range of disk properties, from many that can be fit with actively accreting disks to some with both passive disks and even possibly debris disks. We find that the luminosity function of YSO's in Serpens extends down to at least a few x .001 Lsun or lower for an assumed distance of 260 pc. The lower limit may be set by our inability to distinguish YSO's from extra-galactic sources more than by the lack of YSO's at very low luminosities. A spatial clustering analysis shows that the nominally less-evolved YSO's are more highly clustered than the later stages and that the background extra-galactic population can be fit by the same two-point correlation function as seen in other extra-galactic studies. We also present a table of matches between several previous infrared and X-ray studies of the Serpens YSO population and our Spitzer data set.
10|Partial cubes: structures, characterizations, and constructions|Sergei Ovchinnikov|Partial cubes are isometric subgraphs of hypercubes. Structures on a graph defined by means of semicubes, and Djokovi\'{c}'s and Winkler's relations play an important role in the theory of partial cubes. These structures are employed in the paper to characterize bipartite graphs and partial cubes of arbitrary dimension. New characterizations are established and new proofs of some known results are given.   The operations of Cartesian product and pasting, and expansion and contraction processes are utilized in the paper to construct new partial cubes from old ones. In particular, the isometric and lattice dimensions of finite partial cubes obtained by means of these operations are calculated.
11|Computing genus 2 Hilbert-Siegel modular forms over $\Q(\sqrt{5})$ via   the Jacquet-Langlands correspondence|Clifton Cunningham and Lassina Dembele|In this paper we present an algorithm for computing Hecke eigensystems of Hilbert-Siegel cusp forms over real quadratic fields of narrow class number one. We give some illustrative examples using the quadratic field $\Q(\sqrt{5})$. In those examples, we identify Hilbert-Siegel eigenforms that are possible lifts from Hilbert eigenforms.
12|Distribution of integral Fourier Coefficients of a Modular Form of Half   Integral Weight Modulo Primes|Dohoon Choi|Recently, Bruinier and Ono classified cusp forms $f(z) := \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} a_f(n)q ^n \in S_{\lambda+1/2}(\Gamma_0(N),\chi)\cap \mathbb{Z}[[q]]$ that does not satisfy a certain distribution property for modulo odd primes $p$. In this paper, using Rankin-Cohen Bracket, we extend this result to modular forms of half integral weight for primes $p \geq 5$. As applications of our main theorem we derive distribution properties, for modulo primes $p\geq5$, of traces of singular moduli and Hurwitz class number. We also study an analogue of Newman's conjecture for overpartitions.
13|$p$-adic Limit of Weakly Holomorphic Modular Forms of Half Integral   Weight|Dohoon Choi and YoungJu Choie|Serre obtained the p-adic limit of the integral Fourier coefficient of modular forms on $SL_2(\mathbb{Z})$ for $p=2,3,5,7$. In this paper, we extend the result of Serre to weakly holomorphic modular forms of half integral weight on $\Gamma_{0}(4N)$ for $N=1,2,4$. A proof is based on linear relations among Fourier coefficients of modular forms of half integral weight. As applications we obtain congruences of Borcherds exponents, congruences of quotient of Eisentein series and congruences of values of $L$-functions at a certain point are also studied. Furthermore, the congruences of the Fourier coefficients of Siegel modular forms on Maass Space are obtained using Ikeda lifting.
14|Iterated integral and the loop product|Koichi Fujii|In this article we discuss a relation between the string topology and differential forms based on the theory of Chen's iterated integrals and the cyclic bar complex.
15|Fermionic superstring loop amplitudes in the pure spinor formalism|Christian Stahn|The pure spinor formulation of the ten-dimensional superstring leads to manifestly supersymmetric loop amplitudes, expressed as integrals in pure spinor superspace. This paper explores different methods to evaluate these integrals and then uses them to calculate the kinematic factors of the one-loop and two-loop massless four-point amplitudes involving two and four Ramond states.
16|Lifetime of doubly charmed baryons|Chao-Hsi Chang, Tong Li, Xue-Qian Li and Yu-Ming Wang|In this work, we evaluate the lifetimes of the doubly charmed baryons $\Xi_{cc}^{+}$, $\Xi_{cc}^{++}$ and $\Omega_{cc}^{+}$. We carefully calculate the non-spectator contributions at the quark level where the Cabibbo-suppressed diagrams are also included. The hadronic matrix elements are evaluated in the simple non-relativistic harmonic oscillator model. Our numerical results are generally consistent with that obtained by other authors who used the diquark model. However, all the theoretical predictions on the lifetimes are one order larger than the upper limit set by the recent SELEX measurement. This discrepancy would be clarified by the future experiment, if more accurate experiment still confirms the value of the SELEX collaboration, there must be some unknown mechanism to be explored.
17|Spectroscopic Observations of the Intermediate Polar EX Hydrae in   Quiescence|Nceba Mhlahlo, David H. Buckley, Vikram S. Dhillon, Steven B. Potter,   Brian Warner and Patric A. Woudt|Results from spectroscopic observations of the Intermediate Polar (IP) EX Hya in quiescence during 1991 and 2001 are presented. Spin-modulated radial velocities consistent with an outer disc origin were detected for the first time in an IP. The spin pulsation was modulated with velocities near ~500-600 km/s. These velocities are consistent with those of material circulating at the outer edge of the accretion disc, suggesting corotation of the accretion curtain with material near the Roche lobe radius. Furthermore, spin Doppler tomograms have revealed evidence of the accretion curtain emission extending from velocities of ~500 km/s to ~1000 km/s. These findings have confirmed the theoretical model predictions of King & Wynn (1999), Belle et al. (2002) and Norton et al. (2004) for EX Hya, which predict large accretion curtains that extend to a distance close to the Roche lobe radius in this system. Evidence for overflow stream of material falling onto the magnetosphere was observed, confirming the result of Belle et al. (2005) that disc overflow in EX Hya is present during quiescence as well as outburst. It appears that the hbeta and hgamma spin radial velocities originated from the rotation of the funnel at the outer disc edge, while those of halpha were produced due to the flow of material along the field lines far from the white dwarf (narrow component) and close to the white dwarf (broad-base component), in agreement with the accretion curtain model.
18|In quest of a generalized Callias index theorem|Andreas Gustavsson|We give a prescription for how to compute the Callias index, using as regulator an exponential function. We find agreement with old results in all odd dimensions. We show that the problem of computing the dimension of the moduli space of self-dual strings can be formulated as an index problem in even-dimensional (loop-)space. We think that the regulator used in this Letter can be applied to this index problem.
19|Approximation for extinction probability of the contact process based on   the Gr\"obner basis|Norio Konno|In this note we give a new method for getting a series of approximations for the extinction probability of the one-dimensional contact process by using the Gr\"obner basis.
20|Measurement of the Hadronic Form Factor in D0 --> K- e+ nue Decays|The BABAR Collaboration, B. Aubert, et al|The shape of the hadronic form factor f+(q2) in the decay D0 --> K- e+ nue has been measured in a model independent analysis and compared with theoretical calculations. We use 75 fb(-1) of data recorded by the BABAR detector at the PEPII electron-positron collider. The corresponding decay branching fraction, relative to the decay D0 --> K- pi+, has also been measured to be RD = BR(D0 --> K- e+ nue)/BR(D0 --> K- pi+) = 0.927 +/- 0.007 +/- 0.012. From these results, and using the present world average value for BR(D0 --> K- pi+), the normalization of the form factor at q2=0 is determined to be f+(0)=0.727 +/- 0.007 +/- 0.005 +/- 0.007 where the uncertainties are statistical, systematic, and from external inputs, respectively.
21|Molecular Synchronization Waves in Arrays of Allosterically Regulated   Enzymes|Vanessa Casagrande, Yuichi Togashi, Alexander S. Mikhailov|Spatiotemporal pattern formation in a product-activated enzymic reaction at high enzyme concentrations is investigated. Stochastic simulations show that catalytic turnover cycles of individual enzymes can become coherent and that complex wave patterns of molecular synchronization can develop. The analysis based on the mean-field approximation indicates that the observed patterns result from the presence of Hopf and wave bifurcations in the considered system.
22|Stochastic Lie group integrators|Simon J.A. Malham and Anke Wiese|We present Lie group integrators for nonlinear stochastic differential equations with non-commutative vector fields whose solution evolves on a smooth finite dimensional manifold. Given a Lie group action that generates transport along the manifold, we pull back the stochastic flow on the manifold to the Lie group via the action, and subsequently pull back the flow to the corresponding Lie algebra via the exponential map. We construct an approximation to the stochastic flow in the Lie algebra via closed operations and then push back to the Lie group and then to the manifold, thus ensuring our approximation lies in the manifold. We call such schemes stochastic Munthe-Kaas methods after their deterministic counterparts. We also present stochastic Lie group integration schemes based on Castell--Gaines methods. These involve using an underlying ordinary differential integrator to approximate the flow generated by a truncated stochastic exponential Lie series. They become stochastic Lie group integrator schemes if we use Munthe-Kaas methods as the underlying ordinary differential integrator. Further, we show that some Castell--Gaines methods are uniformly more accurate than the corresponding stochastic Taylor schemes. Lastly we demonstrate our methods by simulating the dynamics of a free rigid body such as a satellite and an autonomous underwater vehicle both perturbed by two independent multiplicative stochastic noise processes.
23|ALMA as the ideal probe of the solar chromosphere|M. A. Loukitcheva, S. K. Solanki and S. White|The very nature of the solar chromosphere, its structuring and dynamics, remains far from being properly understood, in spite of intensive research. Here we point out the potential of chromospheric observations at millimeter wavelengths to resolve this long-standing problem. Computations carried out with a sophisticated dynamic model of the solar chromosphere due to Carlsson and Stein demonstrate that millimeter emission is extremely sensitive to dynamic processes in the chromosphere and the appropriate wavelengths to look for dynamic signatures are in the range 0.8-5.0 mm. The model also suggests that high resolution observations at mm wavelengths, as will be provided by ALMA, will have the unique property of reacting to both the hot and the cool gas, and thus will have the potential of distinguishing between rival models of the solar atmosphere. Thus, initial results obtained from the observations of the quiet Sun at 3.5 mm with the BIMA array (resolution of 12 arcsec) reveal significant oscillations with amplitudes of 50-150 K and frequencies of 1.5-8 mHz with a tendency toward short-period oscillations in internetwork and longer periods in network regions. However higher spatial resolution, such as that provided by ALMA, is required for a clean separation between the features within the solar atmosphere and for an adequate comparison with the output of the comprehensive dynamic simulations.
24|Formation of quasi-solitons in transverse confined ferromagnetic film   media|A.A. Serga, M. Kostylev, and B. Hillebrands|The formation of quasi-2D spin-wave waveforms in longitudinally magnetized stripes of ferrimagnetic film was observed by using time- and space-resolved Brillouin light scattering technique. In the linear regime it was found that the confinement decreases the amplitude of dynamic magnetization near the lateral stripe edges. Thus, the so-called effective dipolar pinning of dynamic magnetization takes place at the edges.   In the nonlinear regime a new stable spin wave packet propagating along a waveguide structure, for which both transversal instability and interaction with the side walls of the waveguide are important was observed. The experiments and a numerical simulation of the pulse evolution show that the shape of the formed waveforms and their behavior are strongly influenced by the confinement.
25|Spectroscopic Properties of Polarons in Strongly Correlated Systems by   Exact Diagrammatic Monte Carlo Method|A. S. Mishchenko (1 and 2) and N. Nagaosa (1 and 3) ((1) CREST, Japan   Science and Technology Agency, (2) Russian Research Centre ``Kurchatov   Institute'', (3) The University of Tokyo)|We present recent advances in understanding of the ground and excited states of the electron-phonon coupled systems obtained by novel methods of Diagrammatic Monte Carlo and Stochastic Optimization, which enable the approximation-free calculation of Matsubara Green function in imaginary times and perform unbiased analytic continuation to real frequencies. We present exact numeric results on the ground state properties, Lehmann spectral function and optical conductivity of different strongly correlated systems: Frohlich polaron, Rashba-Pekar exciton-polaron, pseudo Jahn-Teller polaron, exciton, and interacting with phonons hole in the t-J model.
26|Placeholder Substructures II: Meta-Fractals, Made of Box-Kites, Fill   Infinite-Dimensional Skies|Robert P. C. de Marrais|Zero-divisors (ZDs) derived by Cayley-Dickson Process (CDP) from N-dimensional hypercomplex numbers (N a power of 2, at least 4) can represent singularities and, as N approaches infinite, fractals -- and thereby,scale-free networks. Any integer greater than 8 and not a power of 2 generates a meta-fractal or "Sky" when it is interpreted as the "strut constant" (S) of an ensemble of octahedral vertex figures called "Box-Kites" (the fundamental building blocks of ZDs). Remarkably simple bit-manipulation rules or "recipes" provide tools for transforming one fractal genus into others within the context of Wolfram's Class 4 complexity.
27|Filling-Factor-Dependent Magnetophonon Resonance in Graphene|M. O. Goerbig, J.-N. Fuchs, K. Kechedzhi, Vladimir I. Fal'ko|We describe a peculiar fine structure acquired by the in-plane optical phonon at the Gamma-point in graphene when it is brought into resonance with one of the inter-Landau-level transitions in this material. The effect is most pronounced when this lattice mode (associated with the G-band in graphene Raman spectrum) is in resonance with inter-Landau-level transitions 0 -> (+,1) and (-,1) -> 0, at a magnetic field B_0 ~ 30 T. It can be used to measure the strength of the electron-phonon coupling directly, and its filling-factor dependence can be used experimentally to detect circularly polarized lattice modes.
28|Pfaffians, hafnians and products of real linear functionals|P\'eter E. Frenkel|We prove pfaffian and hafnian versions of Lieb's inequalities on determinants and permanents of positive semi-definite matrices. We use the hafnian inequality to improve the lower bound of R\'ev\'esz and Sarantopoulos on the norm of a product of linear functionals on a real Euclidean space (this subject is sometimes called the `real linear polarization constant' problem).
29|Understanding the Flavor Symmetry Breaking and Nucleon Flavor-Spin   Structure within Chiral Quark Model|Zhan Shu, Xiao-Lin Chen and Wei-Zhen Deng|In $\XQM$, a quark can emit Goldstone bosons. The flavor symmetry breaking in the Goldstone boson emission process is used to intepret the nucleon flavor-spin structure. In this paper, we study the inner structure of constituent quarks implied in $\XQM$ caused by the Goldstone boson emission process in nucleon. From a simplified model Hamiltonian derived from $\XQM$, the intrinsic wave functions of constituent quarks are determined. Then the obtained transition probabilities of the emission of Goldstone boson from a quark can give a reasonable interpretation to the flavor symmetry breaking in nucleon flavor-spin structure.
30|Tuning correlation effects with electron-phonon interactions|J.P.Hague and N.d'Ambrumenil|We investigate the effect of tuning the phonon energy on the correlation effects in models of electron-phonon interactions using DMFT. In the regime where itinerant electrons, instantaneous electron-phonon driven correlations and static distortions compete on similar energy scales, we find several interesting results including (1) A crossover from band to Mott behavior in the spectral function, leading to hybrid band/Mott features in the spectral function for phonon frequencies slightly larger than the band width. (2) Since the optical conductivity depends sensitively on the form of the spectral function, we show that such a regime should be observable through the low frequency form of the optical conductivity. (3) The resistivity has a double kondo peak arrangement
31|Crystal channeling of LHC forward protons with preserved distribution in   phase space|V. M. Biryukov (Serpukhov, IHEP)|We show that crystal can trap a broad (x, x', y, y', E) distribution of particles and channel it preserved with a high precision. This sampled-and-hold distribution can be steered by a bent crystal for analysis downstream. In simulations for the 7 TeV Large Hadron Collider, a crystal adapted to the accelerator lattice traps 90% of diffractively scattered protons emerging from the interaction point with a divergence 100 times the critical angle. We set the criterion for crystal adaptation improving efficiency ~100-fold. Proton angles are preserved in crystal transmission with accuracy down to 0.1 microrad. This makes feasible a crystal application for measuring very forward protons at the LHC.
32|Probing non-standard neutrino interactions with supernova neutrinos|A. Esteban-Pretel, R. Tom\`as and J. W. F. Valle|We analyze the possibility of probing non-standard neutrino interactions (NSI, for short) through the detection of neutrinos produced in a future galactic supernova (SN).We consider the effect of NSI on the neutrino propagation through the SN envelope within a three-neutrino framework, paying special attention to the inclusion of NSI-induced resonant conversions, which may take place in the most deleptonised inner layers. We study the possibility of detecting NSI effects in a Megaton water Cherenkov detector, either through modulation effects in the $\bar\nu_e$ spectrum due to (i) the passage of shock waves through the SN envelope, (ii) the time dependence of the electron fraction and (iii) the Earth matter effects; or, finally, through the possible detectability of the neutronization $\nu_e$ burst. We find that the $\bar\nu_e$ spectrum can exhibit dramatic features due to the internal NSI-induced resonant conversion. This occurs for non-universal NSI strengths of a few %, and for very small flavor-changing NSI above a few$\times 10^{-5}$.
33|Convergence of the discrete dipole approximation. I. Theoretical   analysis|Maxim A. Yurkin, Valeri P. Maltsev, Alfons G. Hoekstra|We performed a rigorous theoretical convergence analysis of the discrete dipole approximation (DDA). We prove that errors in any measured quantity are bounded by a sum of a linear and quadratic term in the size of a dipole d, when the latter is in the range of DDA applicability. Moreover, the linear term is significantly smaller for cubically than for non-cubically shaped scatterers. Therefore, for small d errors for cubically shaped particles are much smaller than for non-cubically shaped. The relative importance of the linear term decreases with increasing size, hence convergence of DDA for large enough scatterers is quadratic in the common range of d. Extensive numerical simulations were carried out for a wide range of d. Finally we discuss a number of new developments in DDA and their consequences for convergence.
34|Origin of adaptive mutants: a quantum measurement?|Vasily Ogryzko|This is a supplement to the paper arXiv:q-bio/0701050, containing the text of correspondence sent to Nature in 1990.
35|Convergence of the discrete dipole approximation. II. An extrapolation   technique to increase the accuracy|Maxim A. Yurkin, Valeri P. Maltsev, Alfons G. Hoekstra|We propose an extrapolation technique that allows accuracy improvement of the discrete dipole approximation computations. The performance of this technique was studied empirically based on extensive simulations for 5 test cases using many different discretizations. The quality of the extrapolation improves with refining discretization reaching extraordinary performance especially for cubically shaped particles. A two order of magnitude decrease of error was demonstrated. We also propose estimates of the extrapolation error, which were proven to be reliable. Finally we propose a simple method to directly separate shape and discretization errors and illustrated this for one test case.
36|A remark on the number of steady states in a multiple futile cycle|Liming Wang and Eduardo D. Sontag|The multisite phosphorylation-dephosphorylation cycle is a motif repeatedly used in cell signaling. This motif itself can generate a variety of dynamic behaviors like bistability and ultrasensitivity without direct positive feedbacks. In this paper, we study the number of positive steady states of a general multisite phosphorylation-dephosphorylation cycle, and how the number of positive steady states varies by changing the biological parameters. We show analytically that (1) for some parameter ranges, there are at least n+1 (if n is even) or n (if n is odd) steady states; (2) there never are more than 2n-1 steady states (in particular, this implies that for n=2, including single levels of MAPK cascades, there are at most three steady states); (3) for parameters near the standard Michaelis-Menten quasi-steady state conditions, there are at most n+1 steady states; and (4) for parameters far from the standard Michaelis-Menten quasi-steady state conditions, there is at most one steady state.
37|The discrete dipole approximation for simulation of light scattering by   particles much larger than the wavelength|Maxim A. Yurkin, Valeri P. Maltsev, Alfons G. Hoekstra|In this manuscript we investigate the capabilities of the Discrete Dipole Approximation (DDA) to simulate scattering from particles that are much larger than the wavelength of the incident light, and describe an optimized publicly available DDA computer program that processes the large number of dipoles required for such simulations. Numerical simulations of light scattering by spheres with size parameters x up to 160 and 40 for refractive index m=1.05 and 2 respectively are presented and compared with exact results of the Mie theory. Errors of both integral and angle-resolved scattering quantities generally increase with m and show no systematic dependence on x. Computational times increase steeply with both x and m, reaching values of more than 2 weeks on a cluster of 64 processors. The main distinctive feature of the computer program is the ability to parallelize a single DDA simulation over a cluster of computers, which allows it to simulate light scattering by very large particles, like the ones that are considered in this manuscript. Current limitations and possible ways for improvement are discussed.
38|The discrete dipole approximation: an overview and recent developments|Maxim A. Yurkin, Alfons G. Hoekstra|We present a review of the discrete dipole approximation (DDA), which is a general method to simulate light scattering by arbitrarily shaped particles. We put the method in historical context and discuss recent developments, taking the viewpoint of a general framework based on the integral equations for the electric field. We review both the theory of the DDA and its numerical aspects, the latter being of critical importance for any practical application of the method. Finally, the position of the DDA among other methods of light scattering simulation is shown and possible future developments are discussed.
39|Scalar radius of the pion and zeros in the form factor|Jose A. Oller and Luis Roca|The quadratic pion scalar radius, \la r^2\ra^\pi_s, plays an important role for present precise determinations of \pi\pi scattering. Recently, Yndur\'ain, using an Omn\`es representation of the null isospin(I) non-strange pion scalar form factor, obtains \la r^2\ra^\pi_s=0.75\pm 0.07 fm^2. This value is larger than the one calculated by solving the corresponding Muskhelishvili-Omn\`es equations, \la r^2\ra^\pi_s=0.61\pm 0.04 fm^2. A large discrepancy between both values, given the precision, then results. We reanalyze Yndur\'ain's method and show that by imposing continuity of the resulting pion scalar form factor under tiny changes in the input \pi\pi phase shifts, a zero in the form factor for some S-wave I=0 T-matrices is then required. Once this is accounted for, the resulting value is \la r^2\ra_s^\pi=0.65\pm 0.05 fm^2. The main source of error in our determination is present experimental uncertainties in low energy S-wave I=0 \pi\pi phase shifts. Another important contribution to our error is the not yet settled asymptotic behaviour of the phase of the scalar form factor from QCD.
40|Multilinear function series in conditionally free probability with   amalgamation|Mihai Popa|As in the cases of freeness and monotonic independence, the notion of conditional freeness is meaningful when complex-valued states are replaced by positive conditional expectations. In this framework, the paper presents several positivity results, a version of the central limit theorem and an analogue of the conditionally free R-transform constructed by means of multilinear function series.
41|Quantum Group of Isometries in Classical and Noncommutative Geometry|Debashish Goswami|We formulate a quantum generalization of the notion of the group of Riemannian isometries for a compact Riemannian manifold, by introducing a natural notion of smooth and isometric action by a compact quantum group on a classical or noncommutative manifold described by spectral triples, and then proving the existence of a universal object (called the quantum isometry group) in the category of compact quantum groups acting smoothly and isometrically on a given (possibly noncommutative) manifold satisfying certain regularity assumptions. In fact, we identify the quantum isometry group with the universal object in a bigger category, namely the category of `quantum families of smooth isometries', defined along the line of Woronowicz and Soltan. We also construct a spectral triple on the Hilbert space of forms on a noncommutative manifold which is equivariant with respect to a natural unitary representation of the quantum isometry group. We give explicit description of quantum isometry groups of commutative and noncommutative tori, and in this context, obtain the quantum double torus defined in \cite{hajac} as the universal quantum group of holomorphic isometries of the noncommutative torus.
42|General System theory, Like-Quantum Semantics and Fuzzy Sets|Ignazio Licata|It is outlined the possibility to extend the quantum formalism in relation to the requirements of the general systems theory. It can be done by using a quantum semantics arising from the deep logical structure of quantum theory. It is so possible taking into account the logical openness relationship between observer and system. We are going to show how considering the truth-values of quantum propositions within the context of the fuzzy sets is here more useful for systemics . In conclusion we propose an example of formal quantum coherence.
43|Nonequilibrium entropy limiters in lattice Boltzmann methods|R.A. Brownlee, A.N. Gorban, J. Levesley|We construct a system of nonequilibrium entropy limiters for the lattice Boltzmann methods (LBM). These limiters erase spurious oscillations without blurring of shocks, and do not affect smooth solutions. In general, they do the same work for LBM as flux limiters do for finite differences, finite volumes and finite elements methods, but for LBM the main idea behind the construction of nonequilibrium entropy limiter schemes is to transform a field of a scalar quantity - nonequilibrium entropy. There are two families of limiters: (i) based on restriction of nonequilibrium entropy (entropy "trimming") and (ii) based on filtering of nonequilibrium entropy (entropy filtering). The physical properties of LBM provide some additional benefits: the control of entropy production and accurate estimate of introduced artificial dissipation are possible. The constructed limiters are tested on classical numerical examples: 1D athermal shock tubes with an initial density ratio 1:2 and the 2D lid-driven cavity for Reynolds numbers Re between 2000 and 7500 on a coarse 100*100 grid. All limiter constructions are applicable for both entropic and non-entropic quasiequilibria.
44|Astrophysical gyrokinetics: kinetic and fluid turbulent cascades in   magnetized weakly collisional plasmas|A. A. Schekochihin (Oxford), S. C. Cowley (Culham), W. Dorland   (Maryland), G. W. Hammett (Princeton), G. G. Howes (Iowa), E. Quataert   (Berkeley), T. Tatsuno (Maryland)|We present a theoretical framework for plasma turbulence in astrophysical plasmas (solar wind, interstellar medium, galaxy clusters, accretion disks). The key assumptions are that the turbulence is anisotropic with respect to the mean magnetic field and frequencies are low compared to the ion cyclotron frequency. The energy injected at the outer scale scale has to be converted into heat, which ultimately cannot be done without collisions. A KINETIC CASCADE develops that brings the energy to collisional scales both in space and velocity. Its nature depends on the physics of plasma fluctuations. In each of the physically distinct scale ranges, the kinetic problem is systematically reduced to a more tractable set of equations. In the "inertial range" above the ion gyroscale, the kinetic cascade splits into a cascade of Alfvenic fluctuations, which are governed by the RMHD equations at both the collisional and collisionless scales, and a passive cascade of compressive fluctuations, which obey a linear kinetic equation along the moving field lines associated with the Alfvenic component. In the "dissipation range" between the ion and electron gyroscales, there are again two cascades: the kinetic-Alfven-wave (KAW) cascade governed by two fluid-like Electron RMHD equations and a passive phase-space cascade of ion entropy fluctuations. The latter cascade brings the energy of the inertial-range fluctuations that was damped by collisionless wave-particle interaction at the ion gyroscale to collisional scales in the phase space and leads to ion heating. The KAW energy is similarly damped at the electron gyroscale and converted into electron heat. Kolmogorov-style scaling relations are derived for these cascades. Astrophysical and space-physical applications are discussed in detail.
45|Evolution of solitary waves and undular bores in shallow-water flows   over a gradual slope with bottom friction|G.A. El, R.H.J. Grimshaw, A.M. Kamchatnov|This paper considers the propagation of shallow-water solitary and nonlinear periodic waves over a gradual slope with bottom friction in the framework of a variable-coefficient Korteweg-de Vries equation. We use the Whitham averaging method, using a recent development of this theory for perturbed integrable equations. This general approach enables us not only to improve known results on the adiabatic evolution of isolated solitary waves and periodic wave trains in the presence of variable topography and bottom friction, modeled by the Chezy law, but also importantly, to study the effects of these factors on the propagation of undular bores, which are essentially unsteady in the system under consideration. In particular, it is shown that the combined action of variable topography and bottom friction generally imposes certain global restrictions on the undular bore propagation so that the evolution of the leading solitary wave can be substantially different from that of an isolated solitary wave with the same initial amplitude. This non-local effect is due to nonlinear wave interactions within the undular bore and can lead to an additional solitary wave amplitude growth, which cannot be predicted in the framework of the traditional adiabatic approach to the propagation of solitary waves in slowly varying media.
46|A limit relation for entropy and channel capacity per unit cost|I. Csiszar, F. Hiai and D. Petz|In a quantum mechanical model, Diosi, Feldmann and Kosloff arrived at a conjecture stating that the limit of the entropy of certain mixtures is the relative entropy as system size goes to infinity. The conjecture is proven in this paper for density matrices. The first proof is analytic and uses the quantum law of large numbers. The second one clarifies the relation to channel capacity per unit cost for classical-quantum channels. Both proofs lead to generalization of the conjecture.
47|Intelligent location of simultaneously active acoustic emission sources:   Part I|T. Kosel and I. Grabec|The intelligent acoustic emission locator is described in Part I, while Part II discusses blind source separation, time delay estimation and location of two simultaneously active continuous acoustic emission sources.   The location of acoustic emission on complicated aircraft frame structures is a difficult problem of non-destructive testing. This article describes an intelligent acoustic emission source locator. The intelligent locator comprises a sensor antenna and a general regression neural network, which solves the location problem based on learning from examples. Locator performance was tested on different test specimens. Tests have shown that the accuracy of location depends on sound velocity and attenuation in the specimen, the dimensions of the tested area, and the properties of stored data. The location accuracy achieved by the intelligent locator is comparable to that obtained by the conventional triangulation method, while the applicability of the intelligent locator is more general since analysis of sonic ray paths is avoided. This is a promising method for non-destructive testing of aircraft frame structures by the acoustic emission method.
48|Inference on white dwarf binary systems using the first round Mock LISA   Data Challenges data sets|Alexander Stroeer, John Veitch, Christian Roever, Ed Bloomer, James   Clark, Nelson Christensen, Martin Hendry, Chris Messenger, Renate Meyer,   Matthew Pitkin, Jennifer Toher, Richard Umstaetter, Alberto Vecchio and   Graham Woan|We report on the analysis of selected single source data sets from the first round of the Mock LISA Data Challenges (MLDC) for white dwarf binaries. We implemented an end-to-end pipeline consisting of a grid-based coherent pre-processing unit for signal detection, and an automatic Markov Chain Monte Carlo post-processing unit for signal evaluation. We demonstrate that signal detection with our coherent approach is secure and accurate, and is increased in accuracy and supplemented with additional information on the signal parameters by our Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach. We also demonstrate that the Markov Chain Monte Carlo routine is additionally able to determine accurately the noise level in the frequency window of interest.
49|An algorithm for the classification of smooth Fano polytopes|Mikkel {\O}bro|We present an algorithm that produces the classification list of smooth Fano d-polytopes for any given d. The input of the algorithm is a single number, namely the positive integer d. The algorithm has been used to classify smooth Fano d-polytopes for d<=7. There are 7622 isomorphism classes of smooth Fano 6-polytopes and 72256 isomorphism classes of smooth Fano 7-polytopes.
50|Intelligent location of simultaneously active acoustic emission sources:   Part II|T. Kosel and I. Grabec|Part I describes an intelligent acoustic emission locator, while Part II discusses blind source separation, time delay estimation and location of two continuous acoustic emission sources.   Acoustic emission (AE) analysis is used for characterization and location of developing defects in materials. AE sources often generate a mixture of various statistically independent signals. A difficult problem of AE analysis is separation and characterization of signal components when the signals from various sources and the mode of mixing are unknown. Recently, blind source separation (BSS) by independent component analysis (ICA) has been used to solve these problems. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate the applicability of ICA to locate two independent simultaneously active acoustic emission sources on an aluminum band specimen. The method is promising for non-destructive testing of aircraft frame structures by acoustic emission analysis.
51|Visualizing Teleportation|Scott M. Cohen|A novel way of picturing the processing of quantum information is described, allowing a direct visualization of teleportation of quantum states and providing a simple and intuitive understanding of this fascinating phenomenon. The discussion is aimed at providing physicists a method of explaining teleportation to non-scientists. The basic ideas of quantum physics are first explained in lay terms, after which these ideas are used with a graphical description, out of which teleportation arises naturally.
52|Quantum Field Theory on Curved Backgrounds. II. Spacetime Symmetries|Arthur Jaffe (1) and Gordon Ritter (1) ((1) Harvard University)|We study space-time symmetries in scalar quantum field theory (including interacting theories) on static space-times. We first consider Euclidean quantum field theory on a static Riemannian manifold, and show that the isometry group is generated by one-parameter subgroups which have either self-adjoint or unitary quantizations. We analytically continue the self-adjoint semigroups to one-parameter unitary groups, and thus construct a unitary representation of the isometry group of the associated Lorentzian manifold. The method is illustrated for the example of hyperbolic space, whose Lorentzian continuation is Anti-de Sitter space.
53|A Global Approach to the Theory of Special Finsler Manifolds|Nabil L. Youssef, S. H. Abed and A. Soleiman|The aim of the present paper is to provide a global presentation of the theory of special Finsler manifolds. We introduce and investigate globally (or intrinsically, free from local coordinates) many of the most important and most commonly used special Finsler manifolds: locally Minkowskian, Berwald, Landesberg, general Landesberg, $P$-reducible, $C$-reducible, semi-$C$-reducible, quasi-$C$-reducible, $P^{*}$-Finsler, $C^{h}$-recurrent, $C^{v}$-recurrent, $C^{0}$-recurrent, $S^{v}$-recurrent, $S^{v}$-recurrent of the second order, $C_{2}$-like, $S_{3}$-like, $S_{4}$-like, $P_{2}$-like, $R_{3}$-like, $P$-symmetric, $h$-isotropic, of scalar curvature, of constant curvature, of $p$-scalar curvature, of $s$-$ps$-curvature. The global definitions of these special Finsler manifolds are introduced. Various relationships between the different types of the considered special Finsler manifolds are found. Many local results, known in the literature, are proved globally and several new results are obtained. As a by-product, interesting identities and properties concerning the torsion tensor fields and the curvature tensor fields are deduced. Although our investigation is entirely global, we provide; for comparison reasons, an appendix presenting a local counterpart of our global approach and the local definitions of the special Finsler spaces considered.
54|The Hardy-Lorentz Spaces $H^{p,q}(R^n)$|Wael Abu-Shammala and Alberto Torchinsky|In this paper we consider the Hardy-Lorentz spaces $H^{p,q}(R^n)$, with $0<p\le 1$, $0<q\le \infty$. We discuss the atomic decomposition of the elements in these spaces, their interpolation properties, and the behavior of singular integrals and other operators acting on them.
55|Potassium intercalation in graphite: A van der Waals density-functional   study|Eleni Ziambaras, Jesper Kleis, Elsebeth Schroder, and Per Hyldgaard|Potassium intercalation in graphite is investigated by first-principles theory. The bonding in the potassium-graphite compound is reasonably well accounted for by traditional semilocal density functional theory (DFT) calculations. However, to investigate the intercalate formation energy from pure potassium atoms and graphite requires use of a description of the graphite interlayer binding and thus a consistent account of the nonlocal dispersive interactions. This is included seamlessly with ordinary DFT by a van der Waals density functional (vdW-DF) approach [Phys. Rev. Lett. 92, 246401 (2004)]. The use of the vdW-DF is found to stabilize the graphite crystal, with crystal parameters in fair agreement with experiments. For graphite and potassium-intercalated graphite structural parameters such as binding separation, layer binding energy, formation energy, and bulk modulus are reported. Also the adsorption and sub-surface potassium absorption energies are reported. The vdW-DF description, compared with the traditional semilocal approach, is found to weakly soften the elastic response.
56|Phase diagram of Gaussian-core nematics|Santi Prestipino and Franz Saija|We study a simple model of a nematic liquid crystal made of parallel ellipsoidal particles interacting via a repulsive Gaussian law. After identifying the relevant solid phases of the system through a careful zero-temperature scrutiny of as many as eleven candidate crystal structures, we determine the melting temperature for various pressure values, also with the help of exact free energy calculations. Among the prominent features of this model are pressure-driven reentrant melting and the stabilization of a columnar phase for intermediate temperatures.
57|High-spin to low-spin and orbital polarization transitions in   multiorbital Mott systems|Philipp Werner and Andrew J. Millis|We study the interplay of crystal field splitting and Hund coupling in a two-orbital model which captures the essential physics of systems with two electrons or holes in the e_g shell. We use single site dynamical mean field theory with a recently developed impurity solver which is able to access strong couplings and low temperatures. The fillings of the orbitals and the location of phase boundaries are computed as a function of Coulomb repulsion, exchange coupling and crystal field splitting. We find that the Hund coupling can drive the system into a novel Mott insulating phase with vanishing orbital susceptibility. Away from half-filling, the crystal field splitting can induce an orbital selective Mott state.
58|Intelligent Life in Cosmology|Frank J. Tipler|I shall present three arguments for the proposition that intelligent life is very rare in the universe. First, I shall summarize the consensus opinion of the founders of the Modern Synthesis (Simpson, Dobzhanski, and Mayr) that the evolution of intelligent life is exceedingly improbable. Second, I shall develop the Fermi Paradox: if they existed they'd be here. Third, I shall show that if intelligent life were too common, it would use up all available resources and die out. But I shall show that the quantum mechanical principle of unitarity (actually a form of teleology!) requires intelligent life to survive to the end of time. Finally, I shall argue that, if the universe is indeed accelerating, then survival to the end of time requires that intelligent life, though rare, to have evolved several times in the visible universe. I shall argue that the acceleration is a consequence of the excess of matter over antimatter in the universe. I shall suggest experiments to test these claims.
59|The Mass and Radius of the Unseen M-Dwarf Companion in the Single-Lined   Eclipsing Binary HAT-TR-205-013|T. G. Beatty, J. M. Fernandez, D. W. Latham, G. A. Bakos, G. Kovacs,   R. W. Noyes, R. P. Stefanik, G. Torres, M. E. Everett, C. W. Hergenrother|We derive masses and radii for both components in the single-lined eclipsing binary HAT-TR-205-013, which consists of a F7V primary and a late M-dwarf secondary. The system's period is short, $P=2.230736 \pm 0.000010$ days, with an orbit indistinguishable from circular, $e=0.012 \pm 0.021$. We demonstrate generally that the surface gravity of the secondary star in a single-lined binary undergoing total eclipses can be derived from characteristics of the light curve and spectroscopic orbit. This constrains the secondary to a unique line in the mass-radius diagram with $M/R^2$ = constant. For HAT-TR-205-013, we assume the orbit has been tidally circularized, and that the primary's rotation has been synchronized and aligned with the orbital axis. Our observed line broadening, $V_{\rm rot} \sin i_{\rm rot} = 28.9 \pm 1.0$ \kms, gives a primary radius of $R_{\rm A} = 1.28 \pm 0.04$ \rsun. Our light curve analysis leads to the radius of the secondary, $R_{\rm B} = 0.167 \pm 0.006$ \rsun, and the semimajor axis of the orbit, $a = 7.54 \pm 0.30 \rsun = 0.0351 \pm 0.0014$ AU. Our single-lined spectroscopic orbit and the semimajor axis then yield the individual masses, $M_{\rm B} = 0.124 \pm 0.010$ \msun and $M_{\rm A} = 1.04 \pm 0.13$ \msun. Our result for HAT-TR-205-013 B lies above the theoretical mass-radius models from the Lyon group, consistent with results from double-lined eclipsing binaries. The method we describe offers the opportunity to study the very low end of the stellar mass-radius relation.
60|Coulomb excitation of unstable nuclei at intermediate energies|C.A. Bertulani, G. Cardella, M. De Napoli, G. Raciti, and E. Rapisarda|We investigate the Coulomb excitation of low-lying states of unstable nuclei in intermediate energy collisions ($E_{lab}\sim10-500$ MeV/nucleon). It is shown that the cross sections for the $E1$ and $E2$ transitions are larger at lower energies, much less than 10 MeV/nucleon. Retardation effects and Coulomb distortion are found to be both relevant for energies as low as 10 MeV/nucleon and as high as 500 MeV/nucleon. Implications for studies at radioactive beam facilities are discussed.
61|Intersection Bodies and Generalized Cosine Transforms|Boris Rubin|Intersection bodies represent a remarkable class of geometric objects associated with sections of star bodies and invoking   Radon transforms, generalized cosine transforms, and the relevant Fourier analysis. The main focus of this article is interrelation between generalized cosine transforms of different kinds in the context of their application to investigation of a certain family of intersection bodies, which we call $\lam$-intersection bodies. The latter include $k$-intersection bodies (in the sense of A. Koldobsky) and unit balls of finite-dimensional subspaces of $L_p$-spaces. In particular, we show that restrictions onto lower dimensional subspaces of the spherical Radon transforms and the generalized cosine transforms preserve their integral-geometric structure. We apply this result to the study of sections of $\lam$-intersection bodies. New characterizations of this class of bodies are obtained and examples are given. We also review some known facts and give them new proofs.
62|On-line Viterbi Algorithm and Its Relationship to Random Walks|Rastislav \v{S}r\'amek, Bro\v{n}a Brejov\'a, Tom\'a\v{s} Vina\v{r}|In this paper, we introduce the on-line Viterbi algorithm for decoding hidden Markov models (HMMs) in much smaller than linear space. Our analysis on two-state HMMs suggests that the expected maximum memory used to decode sequence of length $n$ with $m$-state HMM can be as low as $\Theta(m\log n)$, without a significant slow-down compared to the classical Viterbi algorithm. Classical Viterbi algorithm requires $O(mn)$ space, which is impractical for analysis of long DNA sequences (such as complete human genome chromosomes) and for continuous data streams. We also experimentally demonstrate the performance of the on-line Viterbi algorithm on a simple HMM for gene finding on both simulated and real DNA sequences.
63|Experimental efforts in search of 76Ge Neutrinoless Double Beta Decay|Somnath Choudhury|Neutrinoless double beta decay is one of the most sensitive approaches in non-accelerator particle physics to take us into a regime of physics beyond the standard model. This article is a brief review of the experiments in search of neutrinoless double beta decay from 76Ge. Following a brief introduction of the process of double beta decay from 76Ge, the results of the very first experiments IGEX and Heidelberg-Moscow which give indications of the existence of possible neutrinoless double beta decay mode has been reviewed. Then ongoing efforts to substantiate the early findings are presented and the Majorana experiment as a future experimental approach which will allow a very detailed study of the neutrinoless decay mode is discussed.
64|Nilpotent symmetry invariance in the superfield formulation: the   (non-)Abelian 1-form gauge theories|R. P. Malik (Bhu)|We capture the off-shell as well as the on-shell nilpotent Becchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin (BRST) and anti-BRST symmetry invariance of the Lagrangian densities of the four (3 + 1)-dimensional (4D) (non-)Abelian 1-form gauge theories within the framework of the superfield formalism. In particular, we provide the geometrical interpretations for (i) the above nilpotent symmetry invariance, and (ii) the above Lagrangian densities, in the language of the specific quantities defined in the domain of the above superfield formalism. Some of the subtle points, connected with the 4D (non-)Abelian 1-form gauge theories, are clarified within the framework of the above superfield formalism where the 4D ordinary gauge theories are considered on the (4, 2)-dimensional supermanifold parametrized by the four spacetime coordinates x^\mu (with \mu = 0, 1, 2, 3) and a pair of Grassmannian variables \theta and \bar\theta. One of the key results of our present investigation is a great deal of simplification in the geometrical understanding of the nilpotent (anti-)BRST symmetry invariance.
65|Littlewood-Richardson polynomials|A. I. Molev|We introduce a family of rings of symmetric functions depending on an infinite sequence of parameters. A distinguished basis of such a ring is comprised by analogues of the Schur functions. The corresponding structure coefficients are polynomials in the parameters which we call the Littlewood-Richardson polynomials. We give a combinatorial rule for their calculation by modifying an earlier result of B. Sagan and the author. The new rule provides a formula for these polynomials which is manifestly positive in the sense of W. Graham. We apply this formula for the calculation of the product of equivariant Schubert classes on Grassmannians which implies a stability property of the structure coefficients. The first manifestly positive formula for such an expansion was given by A. Knutson and T. Tao by using combinatorics of puzzles while the stability property was not apparent from that formula. We also use the Littlewood-Richardson polynomials to describe the multiplication rule in the algebra of the Casimir elements for the general linear Lie algebra in the basis of the quantum immanants constructed by A. Okounkov and G. Olshanski.
66|Lagrangian quantum field theory in momentum picture. IV. Commutation   relations for free fields|Bozhidar Z. Iliev (Institute for Nuclear Research and Nuclear Energy,   Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, Sofia, Bulgaria)|Possible (algebraic) commutation relations in the Lagrangian quantum theory of free (scalar, spinor and vector) fields are considered from mathematical view-point. As sources of these relations are employed the Heisenberg equations/relations for the dynamical variables and a specific condition for uniqueness of the operators of the dynamical variables (with respect to some class of Lagrangians). The paracommutation relations or some their generalizations are pointed as the most general ones that entail the validity of all Heisenberg equations. The simultaneous fulfillment of the Heisenberg equations and the uniqueness requirement turn to be impossible. This problem is solved via a redefinition of the dynamical variables, similar to the normal ordering procedure and containing it as a special case. That implies corresponding changes in the admissible commutation relations. The introduction of the concept of the vacuum makes narrow the class of the possible commutation relations; in particular, the mentioned redefinition of the dynamical variables is reduced to normal ordering. As a last restriction on that class is imposed the requirement for existing of an effective procedure for calculating vacuum mean values. The standard bilinear commutation relations are pointed as the only known ones that satisfy all of the mentioned conditions and do not contradict to the existing data.
67|Order of Epitaxial Self-Assembled Quantum Dots: Linear Analysis|Lawrence H. Friedman|Epitaxial self-assembled quantum dots (SAQDs) are of interest for nanostructured optoelectronic and electronic devices such as lasers, photodetectors and nanoscale logic. Spatial order and size order of SAQDs are important to the development of usable devices. It is likely that these two types of order are strongly linked; thus, a study of spatial order will also have strong implications for size order. Here a study of spatial order is undertaken using a linear analysis of a commonly used model of SAQD formation based on surface diffusion. Analytic formulas for film-height correlation functions are found that characterize quantum dot spatial order and corresponding correlation lengths that quantify order. Initial atomic-scale random fluctuations result in relatively small correlation lengths (about two dots) when the effect of a wetting potential is negligible; however, the correlation lengths diverge when SAQDs are allowed to form at a near-critical film height. The present work reinforces previous findings about anisotropy and SAQD order and presents as explicit and transparent mechanism for ordering with corresponding analytic equations. In addition, SAQD formation is by its nature a stochastic process, and various mathematical aspects regarding statistical analysis of SAQD formation and order are presented.
68|A Note About the {Ki(z)} Functions|Branko J. Malesevic|In the article [Petojevic 2006], A. Petojevi\' c verified useful properties of the $K_{i}(z)$ functions which generalize Kurepa's [Kurepa 1971] left factorial function. In this note, we present simplified proofs of two of these results and we answer the open question stated in [Petojevic 2006]. Finally, we discuss the differential transcendency of the $K_{i}(z)$ functions.
69|Dynamical Objects for Cohomologically Expanding Maps|John W. Robertson|The goal of this paper is to construct invariant dynamical objects for a (not necessarily invertible) smooth self map of a compact manifold. We prove a result that takes advantage of differences in rates of expansion in the terms of a sheaf cohomological long exact sequence to create unique lifts of finite dimensional invariant subspaces of one term of the sequence to invariant subspaces of the preceding term. This allows us to take invariant cohomological classes and under the right circumstances construct unique currents of a given type, including unique measures of a given type, that represent those classes and are invariant under pullback. A dynamically interesting self map may have a plethora of invariant measures, so the uniquess of the constructed currents is important. It means that if local growth is not too big compared to the growth rate of the cohomological class then the expanding cohomological class gives sufficient "marching orders" to the system to prohibit the formation of any other such invariant current of the same type (say from some local dynamical subsystem). Because we use subsheaves of the sheaf of currents we give conditions under which a subsheaf will have the same cohomology as the sheaf containing it. Using a smoothing argument this allows us to show that the sheaf cohomology of the currents under consideration can be canonically identified with the deRham cohomology groups. Our main theorem can be applied in both the smooth and holomorphic setting.
70|Coincidence of the oscillations in the dipole transition and in the   persistent current of narrow quantum rings with two electrons|He Yanzhang and Bao Chengguang|The fractional Aharonov-Bohm oscillation (FABO) of narrow quantum rings with two electrons has been studied and has been explained in an analytical way, the evolution of the period and amplitudes against the magnetic field can be exactly described. Furthermore, the dipole transition of the ground state was found to have essentially two frequencies, their difference appears as an oscillation matching the oscillation of the persistent current exactly. A number of equalities relating the observables and dynamical parameters have been found.
71|Pairwise comparisons of typological profiles (of languages)|S. Wichmann and E.W. Holman|No abstract given; compares pairs of languages from World Atlas of Language Structures.
72|The decomposition method and Maple procedure for finding first integrals   of nonlinear PDEs of any order with any number of independent variables|Yu.N. Kosovtsov|In present paper we propose seemingly new method for finding solutions of some types of nonlinear PDEs in closed form. The method is based on decomposition of nonlinear operators on sequence of operators of lower orders. It is shown that decomposition process can be done by iterative procedure(s), each step of which is reduced to solution of some auxiliary PDEs system(s) for one dependent variable. Moreover, we find on this way the explicit expression of the first-order PDE(s) for first integral of decomposable initial PDE. Remarkably that this first-order PDE is linear if initial PDE is linear in its highest derivatives.   The developed method is implemented in Maple procedure, which can really solve many of different order PDEs with different number of independent variables. Examples of PDEs with calculated their general solutions demonstrate a potential of the method for automatic solving of nonlinear PDEs.
73|A transcendental approach to Koll\'ar's injectivity theorem|Osamu Fujino|We treat Koll\'ar's injectivity theorem from the analytic (or differential geometric) viewpoint. More precisely, we give a curvature condition which implies Koll\'ar type cohomology injectivity theorems. Our main theorem is formulated for a compact K\"ahler manifold, but the proof uses the space of harmonic forms on a Zariski open set with a suitable complete K\"ahler metric. We need neither covering tricks, desingularizations, nor Leray's spectral sequence.
74|Injective Morita contexts (revisited)|J. Y. Abuhlail, S. K. Nauman|This paper is an exposition of the so-called injective Morita contexts (in which the connecting bimodule morphisms are injective) and Morita $\alpha$contexts (in which the connecting bimodules enjoy some local projectivity in the sense of Zimmermann-Huisgen). Motivated by situations in which only one trace ideal is in action, or the compatibility between the bimodule morphisms is not needed, we introduce the notions of Morita semi-contexts and Morita data, and investigate them. Injective Morita data will be used (with the help of static and adstatic modules) to establish equivalences between some intersecting subcategories related to subcategories of modules that are localized or colocalized by trace ideals of a Morita datum. We end up with applications of Morita $\alpha$-contexts to $\ast$-modules and injective right wide Morita contexts.
75|Strong decays of charmed baryons|Chong Chen, Xiao-Lin Chen, Xiang Liu, Wei-Zhen Deng and Shi-Lin Zhu|There has been important experimental progress in the sector of heavy baryons in the past several years. We study the strong decays of the S-wave, P-wave, D-wave and radially excited charmed baryons using the $^3P_0$ model. After comparing the calculated decay pattern and total width with the available data, we discuss the possible internal structure and quantum numbers of those charmed baryons observed recently.
76|CP violation in beauty decays|Michael Gronau|Precision tests of the Kobayashi-Maskawa model of CP violation are discussed, pointing out possible signatures for other sources of CP violation and for new flavor-changing operators. The current status of the most accurate tests is summarized.
77|Universal Forces and the Dark Energy Problem|Afsar Abbas|The Dark Energy problem is forcing us to re-examine our models and our understanding of relativity and space-time. Here a novel idea of Fundamental Forces is introduced. This allows us to perceive the General Theory of Relativity and Einstein's Equation from a new pesrpective. In addition to providing us with an improved understanding of space and time, it will be shown how it leads to a resolution of the Dark Energy problem.
78|Linear perturbations of matched spacetimes: the gauge problem and   background symmetries|Marc Mars, Filipe C. Mena, Raul Vera|We present a critical review about the study of linear perturbations of matched spacetimes including gauge problems. We analyse the freedom introduced in the perturbed matching by the presence of background symmetries and revisit the particular case of spherically symmetry in n-dimensions. This analysis includes settings with boundary layers such as brane world models and shell cosmologies.
79|Operator algebras associated with unitary commutation relations|Stephen C. Power (Lancaster University), Baruch Solel (Technion)|We define nonselfadjoint operator algebras with generators $L_{e_1},..., L_{e_n}, L_{f_1},...,L_{f_m}$ subject to the unitary commutation relations of the form \[ L_{e_i}L_{f_j} = \sum_{k,l} u_{i,j,k,l} L_{f_l}L_{e_k}\] where $u= (u_{i,j,k,l})$ is an $nm \times nm$ unitary matrix. These algebras, which generalise the analytic Toeplitz algebras of rank 2 graphs with a single vertex, are classified up to isometric isomorphism in terms of the matrix $u$.
80|Shaping the Globular Cluster Mass Function by Stellar-Dynamical   Evaporation|Dean E. McLaughlin and S. Michael Fall|We show that the globular cluster mass function (GCMF) in the Milky Way depends on cluster half-mass density (rho_h) in the sense that the turnover mass M_TO increases with rho_h while the width of the GCMF decreases. We argue that this is the expected signature of the slow erosion of a mass function that initially rose towards low masses, predominantly through cluster evaporation driven by internal two-body relaxation. We find excellent agreement between the observed GCMF -- including its dependence on internal density rho_h, central concentration c, and Galactocentric distance r_gc -- and a simple model in which the relaxation-driven mass-loss rates of clusters are approximated by -dM/dt = mu_ev ~ rho_h^{1/2}. In particular, we recover the well-known insensitivity of M_TO to r_gc. This feature does not derive from a literal ``universality'' of the GCMF turnover mass, but rather from a significant variation of M_TO with rho_h -- the expected outcome of relaxation-driven cluster disruption -- plus significant scatter in rho_h as a function of r_gc. Our conclusions are the same if the evaporation rates are assumed to depend instead on the mean volume or surface densities of clusters inside their tidal radii, as mu_ev ~ rho_t^{1/2} or mu_ev ~ Sigma_t^{3/4} -- alternative prescriptions that are physically motivated but involve cluster properties (rho_t and Sigma_t) that are not as well defined or as readily observable as rho_h. In all cases, the normalization of mu_ev required to fit the GCMF implies cluster lifetimes that are within the range of standard values (although falling towards the low end of this range). Our analysis does not depend on any assumptions or information about velocity anisotropy in the globular cluster system.
81|Quantum Deformations of Relativistic Symmetries|V.N. Tolstoy (INP, Moscow State University)|We discussed quantum deformations of D=4 Lorentz and Poincare algebras. In the case of Poincare algebra it is shown that almost all classical r-matrices of S. Zakrzewski classification correspond to twisted deformations of Abelian and Jordanian types. A part of twists corresponding to the r-matrices of Zakrzewski classification are given in explicit form.
82|Matter-Wave Bright Solitons with a Finite Background in Spinor   Bose-Einstein Condensates|Tetsuo Kurosaki, Miki Wadati|We investigate dynamical properties of bright solitons with a finite background in the F=1 spinor Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC), based on an integrable spinor model which is equivalent to the matrix nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation with a self-focusing nonlineality. We apply the inverse scattering method formulated for nonvanishing boundary conditions. The resulting soliton solutions can be regarded as a generalization of those under vanishing boundary conditions. One-soliton solutions are derived in an explicit manner. According to the behaviors at the infinity, they are classified into two kinds, domain-wall (DW) type and phase-shift (PS) type. The DW-type implies the ferromagnetic state with nonzero total spin and the PS-type implies the polar state, where the total spin amounts to zero. We also discuss two-soliton collisions. In particular, the spin-mixing phenomenon is confirmed in a collision involving the DW-type. The results are consistent with those of the previous studies for bright solitons under vanishing boundary conditions and dark solitons. As a result, we establish the robustness and the usefulness of the multiple matter-wave solitons in the spinor BECs.
83|Why there is something rather than nothing (out of everything)?|A.O.Barvinsky|The path integral over Euclidean geometries for the recently suggested density matrix of the Universe is shown to describe a microcanonical ensemble in quantum cosmology. This ensemble corresponds to a uniform (weight one) distribution in phase space of true physical variables, but in terms of the observable spacetime geometry it is peaked about complex saddle-points of the {\em Lorentzian} path integral. They are represented by the recently obtained cosmological instantons limited to a bounded range of the cosmological constant. Inflationary cosmologies generated by these instantons at late stages of expansion undergo acceleration whose low-energy scale can be attained within the concept of dynamically evolving extra dimensions. Thus, together with the bounded range of the early cosmological constant, this cosmological ensemble suggests the mechanism of constraining the landscape of string vacua and, simultaneously, a possible solution to the dark energy problem in the form of the quasi-equilibrium decay of the microcanonical state of the Universe.
84|Formation of density singularities in ideal hydrodynamics of freely   cooling inelastic gases: a family of exact solutions|Itzhak Fouxon, Baruch Meerson, Michael Assaf, Eli Livne|We employ granular hydrodynamics to investigate a paradigmatic problem of clustering of particles in a freely cooling dilute granular gas. We consider large-scale hydrodynamic motions where the viscosity and heat conduction can be neglected, and one arrives at the equations of ideal gas dynamics with an additional term describing bulk energy losses due to inelastic collisions. We employ Lagrangian coordinates and derive a broad family of exact non-stationary analytical solutions that depend only on one spatial coordinate. These solutions exhibit a new type of singularity, where the gas density blows up in a finite time when starting from smooth initial conditions. The density blowups signal formation of close-packed clusters of particles. As the density blow-up time $t_c$ is approached, the maximum density exhibits a power law $\sim (t_c-t)^{-2}$. The velocity gradient blows up as $\sim - (t_c-t)^{-1}$ while the velocity itself remains continuous and develops a cusp (rather than a shock discontinuity) at the singularity. The gas temperature vanishes at the singularity, and the singularity follows the isobaric scenario: the gas pressure remains finite and approximately uniform in space and constant in time close to the singularity. An additional exact solution shows that the density blowup, of the same type, may coexist with an "ordinary" shock, at which the hydrodynamic fields are discontinuous but finite. We confirm stability of the exact solutions with respect to small one-dimensional perturbations by solving the ideal hydrodynamic equations numerically. Furthermore, numerical solutions show that the local features of the density blowup hold universally, independently of details of the initial and boundary conditions.
85|A Universality in PP-Waves|Partha Mukhopadhyay|We discuss a universality property of any covariant field theory in space-time expanded around pp-wave backgrounds. According to this property the space-time lagrangian density evaluated on a restricted set of field configurations, called universal sector, turns out to be same around all the pp-waves, even off-shell, with same transverse space and same profiles for the background scalars. In this paper we restrict our discussion to tensorial fields only. In the context of bosonic string theory we consider on-shell pp-waves and argue that universality requires the existence of a universal sector of world-sheet operators whose correlation functions are insensitive to the pp-wave nature of the metric and the background gauge flux. Such results can also be reproduced using the world-sheet conformal field theory. We also study such pp-waves in non-polynomial closed string field theory (CSFT). In particular, we argue that for an off-shell pp-wave ansatz with flat transverse space and dilaton independent of transverse coordinates the field redefinition relating the low energy effective field theory and CSFT with all the massive modes integrated out is at most quadratic in fields. Because of this simplification it is expected that the off-shell pp-waves can be identified on the two sides. Furthermore, given the massless pp-wave field configurations, an iterative method for computing the higher massive modes using the CSFT equations of motion has been discussed. All our bosonic string theory analyses can be generalised to the common Neveu-Schwarz sector of superstrings.
86|Clustering in a stochastic model of one-dimensional gas|Vladislav V. Vysotsky|We give a quantitative analysis of clustering in a stochastic model of one-dimensional gas. At time zero, the gas consists of $n$ identical particles that are randomly distributed on the real line and have zero initial speeds. Particles begin to move under the forces of mutual attraction. When particles collide, they stick together forming a new particle, called cluster, whose mass and speed are defined by the laws of conservation. We are interested in the asymptotic behavior of $K_n(t)$ as $n\to \infty$, where $K_n(t)$ denotes the number of clusters at time $t$ in the system with $n$ initial particles. Our main result is a functional limit theorem for $K_n(t)$. Its proof is based on the discovered localization property of the aggregation process, which states that the behavior of each particle is essentially defined by the motion of neighbor particles.
87|Approximate solutions to the Dirichlet problem for harmonic maps between   hyperbolic spaces|Duong Minh Duc and Truong Trung Tuyen|Our main result in this paper is the following: Given $H^m, H^n$ hyperbolic spaces of dimensional $m$ and $n$ corresponding, and given a Holder function $f=(s^1,...,f^{n-1}):\partial H^m\to \partial H^n$ between geometric boundaries of $H^m$ and $H^n$. Then for each $\epsilon >0$ there exists a harmonic map $u:H^m\to H^n$ which is continuous up to the boundary (in the sense of Euclidean) and $u_{\partial H^m}=(f^1,...,f^{n-1},\epsilon)$.
88|Some new experimental photonic flame effect features|N.V.Tcherniega|The results of the spectral, energetical and temporal characteristics of radiation in the presence of the photonic flame effect are presented. Artificial opal posed on Cu plate at the temperature of liquid nitrogen boiling point (77 K) being irradiated by nanosecond ruby laser pulse produces long- term luminiscence with a duration till ten seconds with a finely structured spectrum in the the antistocks part of the spectrum. Analogous visible luminescence manifesting time delay appeared in other samples of the artificial opals posed on the same plate. In the case of the opal infiltrated with different nonlinear liquids the threshold of the luminiscence is reduced and the spatial disribution of the bright emmiting area on the opal surface is being changed. In the case of the putting the frozen nonlinear liquids on the Cu plate long-term blue bright luminiscence took place in the frozen species of the liquids. Temporal characteristics of this luminiscence are nearly the same as in opal matrixes.
89|A general approach to statistical modeling of physical laws:   nonparametric regression|I. Grabec|Statistical modeling of experimental physical laws is based on the probability density function of measured variables. It is expressed by experimental data via a kernel estimator. The kernel is determined objectively by the scattering of data during calibration of experimental setup. A physical law, which relates measured variables, is optimally extracted from experimental data by the conditional average estimator. It is derived directly from the kernel estimator and corresponds to a general nonparametric regression. The proposed method is demonstrated by the modeling of a return map of noisy chaotic data. In this example, the nonparametric regression is used to predict a future value of chaotic time series from the present one. The mean predictor error is used in the definition of predictor quality, while the redundancy is expressed by the mean square distance between data points. Both statistics are used in a new definition of predictor cost function. From the minimum of the predictor cost function, a proper number of data in the model is estimated.
90|Real Options for Project Schedules (ROPS)|Lester Ingber|Real Options for Project Schedules (ROPS) has three recursive sampling/optimization shells. An outer Adaptive Simulated Annealing (ASA) optimization shell optimizes parameters of strategic Plans containing multiple Projects containing ordered Tasks. A middle shell samples probability distributions of durations of Tasks. An inner shell samples probability distributions of costs of Tasks. PATHTREE is used to develop options on schedules.. Algorithms used for Trading in Risk Dimensions (TRD) are applied to develop a relative risk analysis among projects.
91|Groups with finitely many conjugacy classes and their automorphisms|Ashot Minasyan|We combine classical methods of combinatorial group theory with the theory of small cancellations over relatively hyperbolic groups to construct finitely generated torsion-free groups that have only finitely many classes of conjugate elements. Moreover, we present several results concerning embeddings into such groups.   As another application of these techniques, we prove that every countable group $C$ can be realized as a group of outer automorphisms of a group $N$, where $N$ is a finitely generated group having Kazhdan's property (T) and containing exactly two conjugacy classes.
92|Energy density for chiral lattice fermions with chemical potential|Christof Gattringer and Ludovit Liptak|We study a recently proposed formulation of overlap fermions at finite density. In particular we compute the energy density as a function of the chemical potential and the temperature. It is shown that overlap fermions with chemical potential reproduce the correct continuum behavior.
93|Aspects of Electron-Phonon Self-Energy Revealed from Angle-Resolved   Photoemission Spectroscopy|W.S. Lee, S. Johnston, T.P. Devereaux, and Z.-X. Shen|Lattice contribution to the electronic self-energy in complex correlated oxides is a fascinating subject that has lately stimulated lively discussions. Expectations of electron-phonon self-energy effects for simpler materials, such as Pd and Al, have resulted in several misconceptions in strongly correlated oxides. Here we analyze a number of arguments claiming that phonons cannot be the origin of certain self-energy effects seen in high-$T_c$ cuprate superconductors via angle resolved photoemission experiments (ARPES), including the temperature dependence, doping dependence of the renormalization effects, the inter-band scattering in the bilayer systems, and impurity substitution. We show that in light of experimental evidences and detailed simulations, these arguments are not well founded.
94|Timing and Lensing of the Colliding Bullet Clusters: barely enough time   and gravity to accelerate the bullet|HongSheng Zhao (SUPA, St Andrews)|We present semi-analytical constraint on the amount of dark matter in the merging bullet galaxy cluster using the classical Local Group timing arguments. We consider particle orbits in potential models which fit the lensing data. {\it Marginally consistent} CDM models in Newtonian gravity are found with a total mass M_{CDM} = 1 x 10^{15}Msun of Cold DM: the bullet subhalo can move with V_{DM}=3000km/s, and the "bullet" X-ray gas can move with V_{gas}=4200km/s. These are nearly the {\it maximum speeds} that are accelerable by the gravity of two truncated CDM halos in a Hubble time even without the ram pressure. Consistency breaks down if one adopts higher end of the error bars for the bullet gas speed (5000-5400km/s), and the bullet gas would not be bound by the sub-cluster halo for the Hubble time. Models with V_{DM}~ 4500km/s ~ V_{gas} would invoke unrealistic large amount M_{CDM}=7x 10^{15}Msun of CDM for a cluster containing only ~ 10^{14}Msun of gas. Our results are generalisable beyond General Relativity, e.g., a speed of $4500\kms$ is easily obtained in the relativistic MONDian lensing model of Angus et al. (2007). However, MONDian model with little hot dark matter $M_{HDM} \le 0.6\times 10^{15}\msun$ and CDM model with a small halo mass $\le 1\times 10^{15}\msun$ are barely consistent with lensing and velocity data.
95|Geometry of Locally Compact Groups of Polynomial Growth and Shape of   Large Balls|Emmanuel Breuillard|We get asymptotics for the volume of large balls in an arbitrary locally compact group G with polynomial growth. This is done via a study of the geometry of G and a generalization of P. Pansu's thesis. In particular, we show that any such G is weakly commensurable to some simply connected solvable Lie group S, the Lie shadow of G. We also show that large balls in G have an asymptotic shape, i.e. after a suitable renormalization, they converge to a limiting compact set which can be interpreted geometrically. We then discuss the speed of convergence, treat some examples and give an application to ergodic theory. We also answer a question of Burago about left invariant metrics and recover some results of Stoll on the irrationality of growth series of nilpotent groups.
96|Much ado about 248|M.C. Nucci and P.G.L. Leach|In this note we present three representations of a 248-dimensional Lie algebra, namely the algebra of Lie point symmetries admitted by a system of five trivial ordinary differential equations each of order forty-four, that admitted by a system of seven trivial ordinary differential equations each of order twenty-eight and that admitted by one trivial ordinary differential equation of order two hundred and forty-four.
97|Conformal Field Theory and Operator Algebras|Yasuyuki Kawahigashi|We review recent progress in operator algebraic approach to conformal quantum field theory. Our emphasis is on use of representation theory in classification theory. This is based on a series of joint works with R. Longo.
98|Sparsely-spread CDMA - a statistical mechanics based analysis|Jack Raymond, David Saad|Sparse Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA), a variation on the standard CDMA method in which the spreading (signature) matrix contains only a relatively small number of non-zero elements, is presented and analysed using methods of statistical physics. The analysis provides results on the performance of maximum likelihood decoding for sparse spreading codes in the large system limit. We present results for both cases of regular and irregular spreading matrices for the binary additive white Gaussian noise channel (BIAWGN) with a comparison to the canonical (dense) random spreading code.
99|On Ando's inequalities for convex and concave functions|Koenraad M.R. Audenaert and Jaspal Singh Aujla|For positive semidefinite matrices $A$ and $B$, Ando and Zhan proved the inequalities $ f(A)+f(B)  \ge  f(A+B) $ and $ g(A)+g(B)  \le  g(A+B) $, for any unitarily invariant norm, and for any non-negative operator monotone $f$ on $[0,\infty)$ with inverse function $g$. These inequalities have very recently been generalised to non-negative concave functions $f$ and non-negative convex functions $g$, by Bourin and Uchiyama, and Kosem, respectively.   In this paper we consider the related question whether the inequalities $ f(A)-f(B)  \le  f(A-B) $, and $ g(A)-g(B)  \ge  g(A-B) $, obtained by Ando, for operator monotone $f$ with inverse $g$, also have a similar generalisation to non-negative concave $f$ and convex $g$. We answer exactly this question, in the negative for general matrices, and affirmatively in the special case when $A\ge B$.   In the course of this work, we introduce the novel notion of $Y$-dominated majorisation between the spectra of two Hermitian matrices, where $Y$ is itself a Hermitian matrix, and prove a certain property of this relation that allows to strengthen the results of Bourin-Uchiyama and Kosem, mentioned above.
100|Topology Change of Black Holes|Daisuke Ida and Masaru Siino|The topological structure of the event horizon has been investigated in terms of the Morse theory. The elementary process of topological evolution can be understood as a handle attachment. It has been found that there are certain constraints on the nature of black hole topological evolution: (i) There are n kinds of handle attachments in (n+1)-dimensional black hole space-times. (ii) Handles are further classified as either of black or white type, and only black handles appear in real black hole space-times. (iii) The spatial section of an exterior of the black hole region is always connected. As a corollary, it is shown that the formation of a black hole with an S**(n-2) x S**1 horizon from that with an S**(n-1) horizon must be non-axisymmetric in asymptotically flat space-times.
101|The birth of string theory|Paolo Di Vecchia|In this contribution we go through the developments that in the years 1968 to 1974 led from the Veneziano model to the bosonic string.
102|Duality and Tameness|Marc Chardin, Steven Dale Cutkosky, Juergen Herzog and Hema Srinivasan|We prove a duality theorem for certain graded algebras and show by various examples different kinds of failure of tameness of local cohomology.
103|Generalized regularly discontinuous solutions of the Einstein equations|Gianluca Gemelli|The physical consistency of the match of piecewise-$C^0$ metrics is discussed. The mathematical theory of gravitational discontinuity hypersurfaces is generalized to cover the match of regularly discontinuous metrics. The mean-value differential geometry framework on a hypersurface is introduced, and corresponding compatibility conditions are deduced. Examples of generalized boundary layers, gravitational shock waves and thin shells are studied.
104|A geometric realization of sl(6,C)|Giovanni Gaiffi, Michele Grassi|Given an orientable weakly self-dual manifold X of rank two, we build a geometric realization of the Lie algebra sl(6,C) as a naturally defined algebra L of endomorphisms of the space of differential forms of X. We provide an explicit description of Serre generators in terms of natural generators of L. This construction gives a bundle on X which is related to the search for a natural Gauge theory on X. We consider this paper as a first step in the study of a rich and interesting algebraic structure.
105|Rigid subsets of symplectic manifolds|Michael Entov and Leonid Polterovich|We show that there is an hierarchy of intersection rigidity properties of sets in a closed symplectic manifold: some sets cannot be displaced by symplectomorphisms from more sets than the others. We also find new examples of rigidity of intersections involving, in particular, specific fibers of moment maps of Hamiltonian torus actions, monotone Lagrangian submanifolds (following the works of P.Albers and P.Biran-O.Cornea), as well as certain, possibly singular, sets defined in terms of Poisson-commutative subalgebras of smooth functions. In addition, we get some geometric obstructions to semi-simplicity of the quantum homology of symplectic manifolds. The proofs are based on the Floer-theoretical machinery of partial symplectic quasi-states.
106|Multiple Parton Scattering in Nuclei: Quark-quark Scattering|Andreas Schafer, Xin-Nian Wang and Ben-Wei Zhang|Modifications to quark and antiquark fragmentation functions due to quark-quark (antiquark) double scattering in nuclear medium are studied systematically up to order \cal{O}(\alpha_{s}^2)$ in deeply inelastic scattering (DIS) off nuclear targets. At the order $\cal{O}(\alpha_s^2)$, twist-four contributions from quark-quark (antiquark) rescattering also exhibit the Landau-Pomeranchuck-Midgal (LPM) interference feature similar to gluon bremsstrahlung induced by multiple parton scattering. Compared to quark-gluon scattering, the modification, which is dominated by $t$-channel quark-quark (antiquark) scattering, is only smaller by a factor of $C_F/C_A=4/9$ times the ratio of quark and gluon distributions in the medium. Such a modification is not negligible for realistic kinematics and finite medium size. The modifications to quark (antiquark) fragmentation functions from quark-antiquark annihilation processes are shown to be determined by the antiquark (quark) distribution density in the medium. The asymmetry in quark and antiquark distributions in nuclei will lead to different modifications of quark and antiquark fragmentation functions inside a nucleus, which qualitatively explains the experimentally observed flavor dependence of the leading hadron suppression in semi-inclusive DIS off nuclear targets. The quark-antiquark annihilation processes also mix quark and gluon fragmentation functions in the large fractional momentum region, leading to a flavor dependence of jet quenching in heavy-ion collisions.
107|Experimental modeling of physical laws|I. Grabec|A physical law is represented by the probability distribution of a measured variable. The probability density is described by measured data using an estimator whose kernel is the instrument scattering function. The experimental information and data redundancy are defined in terms of information entropy. The model cost function, comprised of data redundancy and estimation error, is minimized by the creation-annihilation process.
108|Reducing SAT to 2-SAT|Sergey Gubin|Description of a polynomial time reduction of SAT to 2-SAT of polynomial size.
109|Half-metallic silicon nanowires|Engin Durgun, Deniz Cakir, Nurten Akman, and Salim Ciraci|From first-principles calculations, we predict that transition metal (TM) atom doped silicon nanowires have a half-metallic ground state. They are insulators for one spin-direction, but show metallic properties for the opposite spin direction. At high coverage of TM atoms, ferromagnetic silicon nanowires become metallic for both spin-directions with high magnetic moment and may have also significant spin-polarization at the Fermi level. The spin-dependent electronic properties can be engineered by changing the type of dopant TM atoms, as well as the diameter of the nanowire. Present results are not only of scientific interest, but can also initiate new research on spintronic applications of silicon nanowires.
110|On Equivariant Embedding of Hilbert C^* modules|Debashish Goswami|We prove that an arbitrary (not necessarily countably generated) Hilbert $G$-$\cla$ module on a G-C^* algebra $\cla$ admits an equivariant embedding into a trivial $G-\cla$ module, provided G is a compact Lie group and its action on $\cla$ is ergodic.
111|Invariance and the twisted Chern character : a case study|Debashish Goswami|We give details of the proof of the remark made in \cite{G2} that the Chern characters of the canonical generators on the K homology of the quantum group $SU_q(2)$ are not invariant under the natural $SU_q(2)$ coaction. Furthermore, the conjecture made in \cite{G2} about the nontriviality of the twisted Chern character coming from an odd equivariant spectral triple on $SU_q(2)$ is settled in the affirmative.
112|Placeholder Substructures III: A Bit-String-Driven ''Recipe Theory'' for   Infinite-Dimensional Zero-Divisor Spaces|Robert P. C. de Marrais|Zero-divisors (ZDs) derived by Cayley-Dickson Process (CDP) from N-dimensional hypercomplex numbers (N a power of 2, at least 4) can represent singularities and, as N approaches infinite, fractals -- and thereby,scale-free networks. Any integer greater than 8 and not a power of 2 generates a meta-fractal or "Sky" when it is interpreted as the "strut constant" (S) of an ensemble of octahedral vertex figures called "Box-Kites" (the fundamental building blocks of ZDs). Remarkably simple bit-manipulation rules or "recipes" provide tools for transforming one fractal genus into others within the context of Wolfram's Class 4 complexity.
113|Langmuir blodgett assembly of densely aligned single walled carbon   nanotubes from bulk materials|Xiaolin Li, Li Zhang, Xinran Wang, Iwao Shimoyama, Xiaoming Sun,   Won-Seok Seo and Hongjie Dai (Department of Chemistry, Stanford University.)|Single walled carbon nanotubes exhibit advanced electrical and surface properties useful for high performance nanoelectronics. Important to future manufacturing of nanotube circuits is large scale assembly of SWNTs into aligned forms. Despite progress in assembly and oriented synthesis, pristine SWNTs in aligned and close-packed form remain elusive and needed for high current, speed and density devices through collective operations of parallel SWNTs. Here, we develop a Langmuir Blodgett method achieving monolayers of aligned SWNTs with dense packing, central to which is a non covalent polymer functionalization by PmPV imparting high solubility and stability of SWNTs in an organic solvent DCE. Pressure cycling or annealing during LB film compression reduces hysteresis and facilitates high degree alignment and packing of SWNTs characterized by microscopy and polarized Raman spectroscopy. The monolayer SWNTs are readily patterned for device integration by microfabrication, enabling the highest currents 3mA through the narrowest regions packed with aligned SWNTs thus far.
114|Quantum Phase Transition in the Four-Spin Exchange Antiferromagnet|Valeri N. Kotov, Dao-Xin Yao, A. H. Castro Neto, D. K. Campbell|We study the S=1/2 Heisenberg antiferromagnet on a square lattice with nearest-neighbor and plaquette four-spin exchanges (introduced by A.W. Sandvik, Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 98}, 227202 (2007).)   This model undergoes a quantum phase transition from a spontaneously dimerized phase to N\'eel order at a critical coupling. We show that as the critical point is approached from the dimerized side, the system exhibits strong fluctuations in the dimer background, reflected in the presence of a low-energy singlet mode, with a simultaneous rise in the triplet quasiparticle density. We find that both singlet and triplet modes of high density condense at the transition, signaling restoration of lattice symmetry. In our approach, which goes beyond mean-field theory in terms of the triplet excitations, the transition appears sharp; however since our method breaks down near the critical point, we argue that we cannot make a definite conclusion regarding the order of the transition.
115|Smooth maps with singularities of bounded K-codimensions|Yoshifumi Ando|We will prove the relative homotopy principle for smooth maps with singularities of a given {\cal K}-invariant class with a mild condition. We next study a filtration of the group of homotopy self-equivalences of a given manifold P by considering singularities of non-negative {\cal K}-codimensions.
116|Stringy Jacobi fields in Morse theory|Yong Seung Cho, Soon-Tae Hong|We consider the variation of the surface spanned by closed strings in a spacetime manifold. Using the Nambu-Goto string action, we induce the geodesic surface equation, the geodesic surface deviation equation which yields a Jacobi field, and we define the index form of a geodesic surface as in the case of point particles to discuss conjugate strings on the geodesic surface.
117|Lower ground state due to counter-rotating wave interaction in trapped   ion system|T. Liu, K.L. Wang, and M. Feng|We consider a single ion confined in a trap under radiation of two traveling waves of lasers. In the strong-excitation regime and without the restriction of Lamb-Dicke limit, the Hamiltonian of the system is similar to a driving Jaynes-Cummings model without rotating wave approximation (RWA). The approach we developed enables us to present a complete eigensolutions, which makes it available to compare with the solutions under the RWA. We find that, the ground state in our non-RWA solution is energically lower than the counterpart under the RWA. If we have the ion in the ground state, it is equivalent to a spin dependent force on the trapped ion. Discussion is made for the difference between the solutions with and without the RWA, and for the relevant experimental test, as well as for the possible application in quantum information processing.
118|Strained single-crystal Al2O3 grown layer-by-layer on Nb (110) thin   films|Paul B. Welander and James N. Eckstein|We report on the layer-by-layer growth of single-crystal Al2O3 thin-films on Nb (110). Single-crystal Nb films are first prepared on A-plane sapphire, followed by the evaporation of Al in an O2 background. The first stages of Al2O3 growth are layer-by-layer with hexagonal symmetry. Electron and x-ray diffraction measurements indicate the Al2O3 initially grows clamped to the Nb lattice with a tensile strain near 10%. This strain relaxes with further deposition, and beyond about 5 nm we observe the onset of island growth. Despite the asymmetric misfit between the Al2O3 film and the Nb under-layer, the observed strain is surprisingly isotropic.
119|Quasi-quartet crystal electric field ground state in a tetragonal   CeAg$_2$Ge$_2$ single crystal|A. Thamizhavel, R. Kulkarni and S. K. Dhar|We have successfully grown the single crystals of CeAg$_2$Ge$_2$, for the first time, by flux method and studied the anisotropic physical properties by measuring the electrical resistivity, magnetic susceptibility and specific heat. We found that CeAg$_2$Ge$_2$ undergoes an antiferromagnetic transition at $T_{\rm N}$ = 4.6 K. The electrical resistivity and susceptibility data reveal strong anisotropic magnetic properties. The magnetization measured at $T$ = 2 K exhibited two metamagnetic transitions at $H_{\rm m1}$ = 31 kOe and $H_{\rm m2}$ = 44.7 kOe, for $H \parallel$ [100] with a saturation magnetization of 1.6 $\mu_{\rm B}$/Ce. The crystalline electric field (CEF) analysis of the inverse susceptibility data reveals that the ground state and the first excited states of CeAg$_2$Ge$_2$ are closely spaced indicating a quasi-quartet ground state. The specific heat data lend further support to the presence of closely spaced energy levels.
120|Strong Phase and $D^0-D^0bar$ mixing at BES-III|Xiao-Dong Cheng, Kang-Lin He, Hai-Bo Li, Yi-Fang Wang, Mao-Zhi Yang|Most recently, both BaBar and Belle experiments found evidences of neutral $D$ mixing. In this paper, we discuss the constraints on the strong phase difference in $D^0 \to K\pi$ decay from the measurements of the mixing parameters, $y^\prime$, $y_{CP}$ and $x$ at the $B$ factories. The sensitivity of the measurement of the mixing parameter $y$ is estimated in BES-III experiment at $\psi(3770)$ peak. We also make an estimate on the measurements of the mixing rate $R_M$. Finally, the sensitivity of the strong phase difference at BES-III are obtained by using data near the $D\bar{D}$ threshold with CP tag technique at BES-III experiment.
121|Meta-Stable Brane Configuration of Product Gauge Groups|Changhyun Ahn|Starting from the N=1 SU(N_c) x SU(N_c') gauge theory with fundamental and bifundamental flavors, we apply the Seiberg dual to the first gauge group and obtain the N=1 dual gauge theory with dual matters including the gauge singlets. By analyzing the F-term equations of the superpotential, we describe the intersecting type IIA brane configuration for the meta-stable nonsupersymmetric vacua of this gauge theory. By introducing an orientifold 6-plane, we generalize to the case for N=1 SU(N_c) x SO(N_c') gauge theory with fundamental and bifundamental flavors. Finally, the N=1 SU(N_c) x Sp(N_c') gauge theory with matters is also described very briefly.
122|Spinor dipolar Bose-Einstein condensates; Classical spin approach|M. Takahashi, Sankalpa Ghosh, T. Mizushima, K. Machida|Magnetic dipole-dipole interaction dominated Bose-Einstein condensates are discussed under spinful situations. We treat the spin degrees of freedom as a classical spin vector, approaching from large spin limit to obtain an effective minimal Hamiltonian; a version extended from a non-linear sigma model. By solving the Gross-Pitaevskii equation we find several novel spin textures where the mass density and spin density are strongly coupled, depending upon trap geometries due to the long-range and anisotropic natures of the dipole-dipole interaction.
123|Nonlinear Dynamics of the Phonon Stimulated Emission in Microwave   Solid-State Resonator of the Nonautonomous Phaser Generator|D. N. Makovetskii|The microwave phonon stimulated emission (SE) has been experimentally and numerically investigated in a nonautonomous microwave acoustic quantum generator, called also microwave phonon laser or phaser (see previous works arXiv:cond-mat/0303188 ; arXiv:cond-mat/0402640 ; arXiv:nlin.CG/0703050) Phenomena of branching and long-time refractority (absence of the reaction on the external pulses) for deterministic chaotic and regular processes of SE were observed in experiments with various levels of electromagnetic pumping. At the pumping level growth, the clearly depined increasing of the number of coexisting SE states has been observed both in real physical experiments and in computer simulations. This confirms the analytical estimations of the branching density in the phase space. The nature of the refractority of SE pulses is closely connected with the pointed branching and reflects the crises of strange attractors, i.e. their collisions with unstable periodic components of the higher branches of SE states in the nonautonomous microwave phonon laser.
124|Proper J-holomorphic discs in Stein domains of dimension 2|Bernard Coupet, Alexandre Sukhov, and Alexander Tumanov|We prove the existence of global Bishop discs in a strictly pseudoconvex Stein domain in an almost complex manifold of complex dimension 2.
125|Anisotropic thermo-elasticity in 2D -- Part I: A unified approach|Michael Reissig and Jens Wirth|In this note we develop tools and techniques for the treatment of anisotropic thermo-elasticity in two space dimensions. We use a diagonalisation technique to obtain properties of the characteristic roots of the full symbol of the system in order to prove $L^p$--$L^q$ decay rates for its solutions.
126|I-V characteristics of the vortex state in MgB2 thin films|Huan Yang, Ying Jia, Lei Shan, Yingzi Zhang, Hai-Hu Wen, Chenggang   Zhuang, Zikui Liu, Qi Li, Yi Cui, Xiaoxing Xi|The current-voltage (I-V) characteristics of various MgB2 films have been studied at different magnetic fields parallel to c-axis. At fields \mu0H between 0 and 5T, vortex liquid-glass transitions were found in the I-V isotherms. Consistently, the I-V curves measured at different temperatures show a scaling behavior in the framework of quasi-two-dimension (quasi-2D) vortex glass theory. However, at \mu0 H >= 5T, a finite dissipation was observed down to the lowest temperature here, T=1.7K, and the I-V isotherms did not scale in terms of any known scaling law, of any dimensionality. We suggest that this may be caused by a mixture of \sigma band vortices and \pi band quasiparticles. Interestingly, the I-V curves at zero magnetic field can still be scaled according to the quasi-2D vortex glass formalism, indicating an equivalent effect of self-field due to persistent current and applied magnetic field.
127|Magnetic Fingerprints of sub-100 nm Fe Nanodots|Randy K. Dumas, Chang-Peng Li, Igor V. Roshchin, Ivan K. Schuller and   Kai Liu|Sub-100 nm nanomagnets not only are technologically important, but also exhibit complex magnetization reversal behaviors as their dimensions are comparable to typical magnetic domain wall widths. Here we capture magnetic "fingerprints" of 1 billion Fe nanodots as they undergo a single domain to vortex state transition, using a first-order reversal curve (FORC) method. As the nanodot size increases from 52 nm to 67 nm, the FORC diagrams reveal striking differences, despite only subtle changes in their major hysteresis loops. The 52 nm nanodots exhibit single domain behavior and the coercivity distribution extracted from the FORC distribution agrees well with a calculation based on the measured nanodot size distribution. The 58 and 67 nm nanodots exhibit vortex states, where the nucleation and annihilation of the vortices are manifested as butterfly-like features in the FORC distribution and confirmed by micromagnetic simulations. Furthermore, the FORC method gives quantitative measures of the magnetic phase fractions, and vortex nucleation and annihilation fields.

Swift data are revolutionising our understanding of Gamma Ray Bursts. Since bursts fade rapidly, it is desirable to create and disseminate accurate light curves rapidly.   Aims. To provide the community with an online repository of X-ray light curves obtained with Swift. The light curves should be of the quality expected of published data, but automatically created and updated so as to be self-consistent and rapidly available. Methods. We have produced a suite of programs which automatically generates Swift/XRT light curves of GRBs. Effects of the damage to the CCD, automatic readout-mode switching and pile-up are appropriately handled, and the data are binned with variable bin durations, as necessary for a fading source.   Results. The light curve repository website (http://www.swift.ac.uk/xrt_curves) contains light curves, hardness ratios and deep images for every GRB which Swift's XRT has observed. When new GRBs are detected, light curves are created and updated within minutes of the data arriving at the UK Swift Science Data Centre.
129|On the total disconnectedness of the quotient Aubry set|Alfonso Sorrentino|In this paper we show that the quotient Aubry set associated to certain Lagrangians is totally disconnected (i.e., every connected component consists of a single point). Moreover, we discuss the relation between this problem and a Morse-Sard type property for (difference of) critical subsolutions of Hamilton-Jacobi equations.
130|New simple modular Lie superalgebras as generalized prolongs|Sofiane Bouarroudj, Pavel Grozman, Dimitry Leites|Over algebraically closed fields of characteristic p>2, prolongations of the simple finite dimensional Lie algebras and Lie superalgebras with Cartan matrix are studied for certain simplest gradings of these algebras. Several new simple Lie superalgebras are discovered, serial and exceptional, including superBrown and superMelikyan superalgebras. Simple Lie superalgebras with Cartan matrix of rank 2 are classified.
131|Vacuum Structure and Potential|J.X. Zheng-Johansson|Based on overall experimental observations, especially the pair processes, I developed a model structure of the vacuum along with a basic-particle formation scheme begun in 2000 (with collaborator P-I Johansson). The model consists in that the vacuum is, briefly, filled of neutral but polarizable vacuuons, consisting each of a p-vaculeon and n- vaculeon of charges $+e$ and $-e$ of zero rest masses but with spin motions, assumed interacting each other with a Coulomb force. The model has been introduced in full in a book (Nova Sci, 2005) and referred to in a number of journal/E-print papers. I outline in this easier accessible paper the detailed derivation of the model and a corresponding quantitative determination of the vacuuon size.
132|Counterflow of electrons in two isolated quantum point contacts|V.S. Khrapai, S. Ludwig, J.P. Kotthaus, H.P. Tranitz, W. Wegscheider|We study the interaction between two adjacent but electrically isolated quantum point contacts (QPCs). At high enough source-drain bias on one QPC, the drive QPC, we detect a finite electric current in the second, unbiased, detector QPC. The current generated at the detector QPC always flows in the opposite direction than the current of the drive QPC. The generated current is maximal, if the detector QPC is tuned to a transition region between its quantized conductance plateaus and the drive QPC is almost pinched-off. We interpret this counterflow phenomenon in terms of an asymmetric phonon-induced excitation of electrons in the leads of the detector QPC.
133|PAH emission and star formation in the host of the z~2.56 Cloverleaf QSO|D. Lutz, E. Sturm, L.J. Tacconi, E. Valiante, M. Schweitzer, H.   Netzer, R. Maiolino, P. Andreani, O. Shemmer, S. Veilleux|We report the first detection of the 6.2micron and 7.7micron infrared `PAH' emission features in the spectrum of a high redshift QSO, from the Spitzer-IRS spectrum of the Cloverleaf lensed QSO (H1413+117, z~2.56). The ratio of PAH features and rest frame far-infrared emission is the same as in lower luminosity star forming ultraluminous infrared galaxies and in local PG QSOs, supporting a predominantly starburst nature of the Cloverleaf's huge far-infrared luminosity (5.4E12 Lsun, corrected for lensing). The Cloverleaf's period of dominant QSO activity (Lbol ~ 7E13 Lsun) is coincident with an intense (star formation rate ~1000 Msun/yr) and short (gas exhaustion time ~3E7yr) star forming event.
134|Causal dissipative hydrodynamics for QGP fluid in 2+1 dimensions|A. K. Chaudhuri|In 2nd order causal dissipative theory, space-time evolution of QGP fluid is studied in 2+1 dimensions. Relaxation equations for shear stress tensors are solved simultaneously with the energy-momentum conservation equations. Comparison of evolution of ideal and viscous QGP fluid, initialized under the same conditions, e.g. same equilibration time, energy density and velocity profile, indicate that in a viscous dynamics, energy density or temperature of the fluid evolve slowly, than in an ideal fluid. Cooling gets slower as viscosity increases. Transverse expansion also increases in a viscous dynamics. For the first time we have also studied elliptic flow of 'quarks' in causal viscous dynamics. It is shown that elliptic flow of quarks saturates due to non-equilibrium correction to equilibrium distribution function, and can not be mimicked by an ideal hydrodynamics.
135|A Single Trapped Ion as a Time-Dependent Harmonic Oscillator|Nicolas C. Menicucci and G. J. Milburn|We show how a single trapped ion may be used to test a variety of important physical models realized as time-dependent harmonic oscillators. The ion itself functions as its own motional detector through laser-induced electronic transitions. Alsing et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 94, 220401 (2005)] proposed that an exponentially decaying trap frequency could be used to simulate (thermal) Gibbons-Hawking radiation in an expanding universe, but the Hamiltonian used was incorrect. We apply our general solution to this experimental proposal, correcting the result for a single ion and showing that while the actual spectrum is different from the Gibbons-Hawking case, it nevertheless shares an important experimental signature with this result.
136|Compounding Fields and Their Quantum Equations in the Trigintaduonion   Space|Zihua Weng|The 32-dimensional compounding fields and their quantum interplays in the trigintaduonion space can be presented by analogy with octonion and sedenion electromagnetic, gravitational, strong and weak interactions. In the trigintaduonion fields which are associated with the electromagnetic, gravitational, strong and weak interactions, the study deduces some conclusions of field source particles (quarks and leptons) and intermediate particles which are consistent with current some sorts of interaction theories. In the trigintaduonion fields which are associated with the hyper-strong and strong-weak fields, the paper draws some predicts and conclusions of the field source particles (sub-quarks) and intermediate particles. The research results show that there may exist some new particles in the nature.
137|Topological defects, geometric phases, and the angular momentum of light|S C Tiwari|Recent reports on the intriguing features of vector vortex bearing beams are analyzed using geometric phases in optics. It is argued that the spin redirection phase induced circular birefringence is the origin of topological phase singularities arising in the inhomogeneous polarization patterns. A unified picture of recent results is presented based on this proposition. Angular momentum shift within the light beam (OAM) has exact equivalence with the angular momentum holonomy associated with the geometric phase consistent with our conjecture.
138|Circular and non-circular nearly horizon-skimming orbits in Kerr   spacetimes|Enrico Barausse, Scott A. Hughes, Luciano Rezzolla|We have performed a detailed analysis of orbital motion in the vicinity of a nearly extremal Kerr black hole. For very rapidly rotating black holes (spin a=J/M>0.9524M) we have found a class of very strong field eccentric orbits whose angular momentum L_z increases with the orbit's inclination with respect to the equatorial plane, while keeping latus rectum and eccentricity fixed. This behavior is in contrast with Newtonian intuition, and is in fact opposite to the "normal" behavior of black hole orbits. Such behavior was noted previously for circular orbits; since it only applies to orbits very close to the black hole, they were named "nearly horizon-skimming orbits". Our analysis generalizes this result, mapping out the full generic (inclined and eccentric) family of nearly horizon-skimming orbits. The earlier work on circular orbits reported that, under gravitational radiation emission, nearly horizon-skimming orbits tend to evolve to smaller orbit inclination, toward prograde equatorial configuration. Normal orbits, by contrast, always demonstrate slowly growing orbit inclination (orbits evolve toward the retrograde equatorial configuration). Using up-to-date Teukolsky-fluxes, we have concluded that the earlier result was incorrect: all circular orbits, including nearly horizon-skimming ones, exhibit growing orbit inclination. Using kludge fluxes based on a Post-Newtonian expansion corrected with fits to circular and to equatorial Teukolsky-fluxes, we argue that the inclination grows also for eccentric nearly horizon-skimming orbits. We also find that the inclination change is, in any case, very small. As such, we conclude that these orbits are not likely to have a clear and peculiar imprint on the gravitational waveforms expected to be measured by the space-based detector LISA.
139|The Blue Straggler Population of the Globular Cluster M5|B. Lanzoni (1,2), E. Dalessandro (1,2), F.R. Ferraro (1), C. Mancini   (3), G. Beccari (2,4,5), R.T. Rood (6), M. Mapelli (7), S. Sigurdsson (8) (1   Dip. Astro., Bologna; 2 INAF--Oss. Astro., Bologna, 3 Dip. Astro. e Scienza   dello Spazio, Firenze; 4 Dip. di Scienze della Comunicazione, Teramo; 5   INAF--Oss. Astro. di Collurania, Teramo; 6 Dep. of Astronomy and   Astrophysics, The Pennsylvania State University; 7 S.I.S.S.A., Via Beirut 2 -   4, Trieste; 8 Astronomy Department, University of Virginia)|By combining high-resolution HST and wide-field ground based observations, in ultraviolet and optical bands, we study the Blue Stragglers Star (BSS) population of the galactic globular cluster M5 (NGC 5904) from its very central regions up to its periphery. The BSS distribution is highly peaked in the cluster center, decreases at intermediate radii and rises again outward. Such a bimodal distribution is similar to those previously observed in other globular clusters (M3, 47Tucanae, NGC6752). As for these clusters, dynamical simulations suggest that, while the majority of BSS in M5 could be originated by stellar collisions, a significant fraction (20-40%) of BSS generated by mass transfer processes in primordial binaries is required to reproduce the observed radial distribution. A candidate BSS has been detected beyond the cluster tidal radius. If confirmed, this could represent an interesting case of an "evaporating" BSS.
140|Entanglement entropy of two-dimensional Anti-de Sitter black holes|Mariano Cadoni|Using the AdS/CFT correspondence we derive a formula for the entanglement entropy of the anti-de Sitter black hole in two spacetime dimensions. The leading term in the large black hole mass expansion of our formula reproduces exactly the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy S_{BH}, whereas the subleading term behaves as ln S_{BH}. This subleading term has the universal form typical for the entanglement entropy of physical systems described by effective conformal fields theories (e.g. one-dimensional statistical models at the critical point). The well-known form of the entanglement entropy for a two-dimensional conformal field theory is obtained as analytic continuation of our result and is related with the entanglement entropy of a black hole with negative mass.
141|Towards self-consistent definition of instanton liquid parameters|S.V. Molodtsov, G.M. Zinovjev|The possibility of self-consistent determination of instanton liquid parameters is discussed together with the definition of optimal pseudo-particle configurations and comparing the various pseudo-particle ensembles. The weakening of repulsive interactions between pseudo-particles is argued and estimated.
142|Some aspects of the nonperturbative renormalization of the phi^4 model|J. Kaupuzs|A nonperturbative renormalization of the phi^4 model is considered. First we integrate out only a single pair of conjugated modes with wave vectors +/- q. Then we are looking for the RG equation which would describe the transformation of the Hamiltonian under the integration over a shell Lambda - d Lambda < k < Lambda, where d Lambda -> 0. We show that the known Wegner--Houghton equation is consistent with the assumption of a simple superposition of the integration results for +/- q. The renormalized action can be expanded in powers of the phi^4 coupling constant u in the high temperature phase at u -> 0. We compare the expansion coefficients with those exactly calculated by the diagrammatic perturbative method, and find some inconsistency. It causes a question in which sense the Wegner-Houghton equation is really exact.
143|Instanton Liquid at Finite Temperature and Chemical Potential of Quarks|S.V. Molodtsov, G.M. Zinovjev|Instanton liquid in heated and strongly interacting matter is studied using the variational principle. The dependence of the instanton liquid density (gluon condensate) on the temperature and the quark chemical potential is determined under the assumption that, at finite temperatures, the dominant contribution is given by an ensemble of calorons. The respective one-loop effective quark Lagrangian is used.
144|Eternal inflation and localization on the landscape|D. Podolsky, K. Enqvist|We model the essential features of eternal inflation on the landscape of a dense discretuum of vacua by the potential $V(\phi)=V_{0}+\delta V(\phi)$, where $\delta V(\phi)\ll V_{0}$ is random. We find that the diffusion of the distribution function $\rho(\phi,t)$ of the inflaton expectation value in different Hubble patches may be suppressed due to the effect analogous to the Anderson localization in disordered quantum systems. At $t \to \infty$ only the localized part of the distribution function $\rho (\phi, t)$ survives which leads to dynamical selection principle on the landscape. The probability to measure any but a small value of the cosmological constant in a given Hubble patch on the landscape is exponentially suppressed at $t\to \infty$.
145|Singularity Resolution in Isotropic Loop Quantum Cosmology: Recent   Developments|Ghanashyam Date|Since the past Iagrg meeting in December 2004, new developments in loop quantum cosmology have taken place, especially with regards to the resolution of the Big Bang singularity in the isotropic models. The singularity resolution issue has been discussed in terms of physical quantities (expectation values of Dirac observables) and there is also an ``improved'' quantization of the Hamiltonian constraint. These developments are briefly discussed.   This is an expanded version of the review talk given at the 24$^{\mathrm{th}}$ IAGRG meeting in February 2007.
146|Vortices in Bose-Einstein Condensates: Theory|N. G. Parker, B. Jackson, A. M. Martin, and C. S. Adams|Vortices are pervasive in nature, representing the breakdown of laminar fluid flow and hence playing a key role in turbulence. The fluid rotation associated with a vortex can be parameterized by the circulation $\Gamma=\oint {\rm d}{\bf r}\cdot{\bf v}({\bf r})$ about the vortex, where ${\bf v}({\bf r})$ is the fluid velocity field. While classical vortices can take any value of circulation, superfluids are irrotational, and any rotation or angular momentum is constrained to occur through vortices with quantized circulation. Quantized vortices also play a key role in the dissipation of transport in superfluids. In BECs quantized vortices have been observed in several forms, including single vortices, vortex lattices, and vortex pairs and rings. The recent observation of quantized vortices in a fermionic gas was taken as a clear signature of the underlying condensation and superfluidity of fermion pairs. In addition to BECs, quantized vortices also occur in superfluid Helium, nonlinear optics, and type-II superconductors.
147|A POVM view of the ensemble approach to polarization optics|Sudha, A. V. Gopala Rao, A. R. Usha Devi and A. K. Rajagopal|Statistical ensemble formalism of Kim, Mandel and Wolf (J. Opt. Soc. Am. A 4, 433 (1987)) offers a realistic model for characterizing the effect of stochastic non-image forming optical media on the state of polarization of transmittedlight. With suitable choice of the Jones ensemble, various Mueller transformations - some of which have been unknown so far - are deduced. It is observed that the ensemble approach is formally identical to the positive operator valued measures (POVM) on the quantum density matrix. This observation, in combination with the recent suggestion by Ahnert and Payne (Phys. Rev. A 71, 012330, (2005)) - in the context of generalized quantum measurement on single photon polarization states - that linear optics elements can be employed in setting up all possible POVMs, enables us to propose a way of realizing different types of Mueller devices.
148|Reexamination of spin decoherence in semiconductor quantum dots from   equation-of-motion approach|J. H. Jiang, Y. Y. Wang, and M. W. Wu|The longitudinal and transversal spin decoherence times, $T_1$ and $T_2$, in semiconductor quantum dots are investigated from equation-of-motion approach for different magnetic fields, quantum dot sizes, and temperatures. Various mechanisms, such as the hyperfine interaction with the surrounding nuclei, the Dresselhaus spin-orbit coupling together with the electron--bulk-phonon interaction, the $g$-factor fluctuations, the direct spin-phonon coupling due to the phonon-induced strain, and the coaction of the electron--bulk/surface-phonon interaction together with the hyperfine interaction are included. The relative contributions from these spin decoherence mechanisms are compared in detail. In our calculation, the spin-orbit coupling is included in each mechanism and is shown to have marked effect in most cases. The equation-of-motion approach is applied in studying both the spin relaxation time $T_1$ and the spin dephasing time $T_2$, either in Markovian or in non-Markovian limit. When many levels are involved at finite temperature, we demonstrate how to obtain the spin relaxation time from the Fermi Golden rule in the limit of weak spin-orbit coupling. However, at high temperature and/or for large spin-orbit coupling, one has to use the equation-of-motion approach when many levels are involved. Moreover, spin dephasing can be much more efficient than spin relaxation at high temperature, though the two only differs by a factor of two at low temperature.
149|Construction of initial data for 3+1 numerical relativity|Eric Gourgoulhon (LUTH, CNRS / Observatoire de Paris / Univ. Paris 7)|This lecture is devoted to the problem of computing initial data for the Cauchy problem of 3+1 general relativity. The main task is to solve the constraint equations. The conformal technique, introduced by Lichnerowicz and enhanced by York, is presented. Two standard methods, the conformal transverse-traceless one and the conformal thin sandwich, are discussed and illustrated by some simple examples. Finally a short review regarding initial data for binary systems (black holes and neutron stars) is given.
150|Magnetism and Thermodynamics of Spin-1/2 Heisenberg Diamond Chains in a   Magnetic Field|Bo Gu and Gang Su|The magnetic and thermodynamic properties of spin-1/2 Heisenberg diamond chains are investigated in three different cases: (a) J1, J2, J3>0 (frustrated); (b) J1, J3<0, J2>0 (frustrated); and (c) J1, J2>0, J3<0 (non-frustrated). The density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) technique is invoked to study the properties of the system in the ground state, while the transfer matrix renormalization group (TMRG) technique is applied to explore the thermodynamic properties. The local magnetic moments, spin correlation functions, and static structure factors are discussed in the ground state for the three cases. It is shown that the static structure factor S(q) shows peaks at wavevectors $q=a\pi /3$ (a=0,1,2,3,4,5) for different couplings in a zero magnetic field, which, however in the magnetic fields where the magnetization plateau with m=1/6 pertains, exhibits the peaks only at q=0, $2\pi /3$ and $4\pi /3$, which are found to be couplings-independent. The DMRG results of the zero-field static structure factor can be nicely fitted by a linear superposition of six modes, where two fitting equations are proposed. It is observed that the six modes are closely related to the low-lying excitations of the system. At finite temperatures, the double-peak structures of the susceptibility and specific heat against temperature are obtained, where the peak positions and heights are found to depend on the competition of the couplings. It is also uncovered that the XXZ anisotropy of F and AF couplings leads the system of case (c) to display quite different behaviors. In addition, the experimental data of the susceptibility, specific heat and magnetization for the compound Cu$_{3}$(CO$_{3}$)$_{2}$(OH)$_{2}$ are fairly compared with our TMRG results.
151|Extraction of physical laws from joint experimental data|I. Grabec|The extraction of a physical law y=yo(x) from joint experimental data about x and y is treated. The joint, the marginal and the conditional probability density functions (PDF) are expressed by given data over an estimator whose kernel is the instrument scattering function. As an optimal estimator of yo(x) the conditional average is proposed. The analysis of its properties is based upon a new definition of prediction quality. The joint experimental information and the redundancy of joint measurements are expressed by the relative entropy. With the number of experiments the redundancy on average increases, while the experimental information converges to a certain limit value. The difference between this limit value and the experimental information at a finite number of data represents the discrepancy between the experimentally determined and the true properties of the phenomenon. The sum of the discrepancy measure and the redundancy is utilized as a cost function. By its minimum a reasonable number of data for the extraction of the law yo(x) is specified. The mutual information is defined by the marginal and the conditional PDFs of the variables. The ratio between mutual information and marginal information is used to indicate which variable is the independent one. The properties of the introduced statistics are demonstrated on deterministically and randomly related variables.
152|Kinetic equation for finite systems of fermions with pairing|V.I. Abrosimov, D.M. Brink, A.Dellafiore, F. Matera|The solutions of the Wigner-transformed time-dependent Hartree--Fock--Bogoliubov equations are studied in the constant-$\Delta$ approximation. This approximation is known to violate particle-number conservation. As a consequence, the density fluctuation and the longitudinal response function given by this approximation contain spurious contributions. A simple prescription for restoring both local and global particle-number conservation is proposed. Explicit expressions for the eigenfrequencies of the correlated systems and for the density response function are derived and it is shown that the semiclassical analogous of the quantum single--particle spectrum has an excitation gap of $2\Delta$, in agreement with the quantum result. The collective response is studied for a simplified form of the residual interaction.
153|Reciprocal Symmetry and Classical Discrete Oscillator Incorporating   Half-Integral Energy Levels|Mushfiq Ahmad|Classical oscillator differential equation is replaced by the corresponding (finite time) difference equation. The equation is, then, symmetrized so that it remains invariant under the change d going to -d, where d is the smallest span of time. This symmetric equation has solutions, which come in reciprocally related pairs. One member of a pair agrees with the classical solution and the other is an oscillating solution and does not converge to a limit as d goes to 0. This solution contributes to oscillator energy a term which is a multiple of half-integers.
154|Hadrons in Medium -- Theory confronts experiment|Fabian Eichstaedt, Stefan Leupold, Ulrich Mosel, Pascal Muehlich|In this talk we briefly summarize our theoretical understanding of in-medium selfenergies of hadrons. With the special case of the $\omega$ meson we demonstrate that earlier calculations that predicted a significant lowering of the mass in medium are based on an incorrect treatment of the model Lagrangian; more consistent calculations lead to a significant broadening, but hardly any mass shift. We stress that the experimental reconstruction of hadron spectral functions from measured decay products always requires knowledge of the decay branching ratios which may also be strongly mass-dependent. It also requires a quantitatively reliable treatment of final state interactions which has to be part of any reliable theory.
155|A computer program for fast non-LTE analysis of interstellar line   spectra|Floris van der Tak (SRON Groningen), John Black (Onsala), Fredrik   Schoeier (Stockholm), David Jansen and Ewine van Dishoeck (Leiden)|The large quantity and high quality of modern radio and infrared line observations require efficient modeling techniques to infer physical and chemical parameters such as temperature, density, and molecular abundances. We present a computer program to calculate the intensities of atomic and molecular lines produced in a uniform medium, based on statistical equilibrium calculations involving collisional and radiative processes and including radiation from background sources. Optical depth effects are treated with an escape probability method. The program is available on the World Wide Web at http://www.sron.rug.nl/~vdtak/radex/index.shtml . The program makes use of molecular data files maintained in the Leiden Atomic and Molecular Database (LAMDA), which will continue to be improved and expanded. The performance of the program is compared with more approximate and with more sophisticated methods. An Appendix provides diagnostic plots to estimate physical parameters from line intensity ratios of commonly observed molecules. This program should form an important tool in analyzing observations from current and future radio and infrared telescopes.

157|Alternative Approaches to the Equilibrium Properties of Hard-Sphere   Liquids|M. Lopez de Haro, S. B. Yuste, and A. Santos|An overview of some analytical approaches to the computation of the structural and thermodynamic properties of single component and multicomponent hard-sphere fluids is provided. For the structural properties, they yield a thermodynamically consistent formulation, thus improving and extending the known analytical results of the Percus-Yevick theory. Approximate expressions for the contact values of the radial distribution functions and the corresponding analytical equations of state are also discussed. Extensions of this methodology to related systems, such as sticky hard spheres and square-well fluids, as well as its use in connection with the perturbation theory of fluids are briefly addressed.
158|Complexities of Human Promoter Sequences|Fangcui Zhao, Huijie Yang, and Binghong Wang|By means of the diffusion entropy approach, we detect the scale-invariance characteristics embedded in the 4737 human promoter sequences. The exponent for the scale-invariance is in a wide range of $[ {0.3,0.9} ]$, which centered at $\delta_c = 0.66$. The distribution of the exponent can be separated into left and right branches with respect to the maximum. The left and right branches are asymmetric and can be fitted exactly with Gaussian form with different widths, respectively.
159|Evidence for an excitonic insulator phase in 1T-TiSe$_{2}$|H. Cercellier, C. Monney, F. Clerc, C. Battaglia, L. Despont, M. G.   Garnier, H. Beck, L. Patthey, H. Berger, P. Aebi|We present a new high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission study of 1\textit{T}-TiSe$_{2}$ in both, its room-temperature, normal phase and its low-temperature, charge-density wave phase. At low temperature the photoemission spectra are strongly modified, with large band renormalisations at high-symmetry points of the Brillouin zone and a very large transfer of spectral weight to backfolded bands. A theoretical calculation of the spectral function for an excitonic insulator phase reproduces the experimental features with very good agreement. This gives strong evidence in favour of the excitonic insulator scenario as a driving force for the charge-density wave transition in 1\textit{T}-TiSe$_{2}$.
160|Oxygen-rich droplets and the enrichment of the ISM|G. Stasinska, G. Tenorio-Tagle, M. Rodriguez, W. J. Henney|We argue that the discrepancies observed in HII regions between abundances derived from optical recombination lines (ORLs) and collisionally excited lines (CELs) might well be the signature of a scenario of the enrichment of the interstellar medium (ISM) proposed by Tenorio-Tagle (1996). In this scenario, the fresh oxygen released during massive supernova explosions is confined within the hot superbubbles as long as supernovae continue to explode. Only after the last massive supernova explosion, the metal-rich gas starts cooling down and falls on the galaxy within metal-rich droplets. Full mixing of these metal-rich droplets and the ISM occurs during photoionization by the next generations of massive stars. During this process, the metal-rich droplets give rise to strong recombination lines of the metals, leading to the observed ORL-CEL discrepancy.

161|Soft modes and NTE in Zn(CN)2 from Raman spectroscopy and first   principles calculations|T. R. Ravindran, A. K. Arora, Sharat Chandra, M. C. Valsakumar and N.   V. Chandra Shekar|We have studied Zn(CN)2 at high pressure using Raman spectroscopy, and report Gruneisen parameters of the soft phonons. The phonon frequencies and eigen vectors obtained from ab-initio calculations are used for the assignment of the observed phonon spectra. Out of the eleven zone-centre optical modes, six modes exhibit negative Gruneisen parameter. The calculations suggest that the soft phonons correspond to the librational and translational modes of CN rigid unit, with librational modes contributing more to thermal expansion. A rapid disordering of the lattice is found above 1.6 GPa from X-ray diffraction.
162|Estimation of experimental data redundancy and related statistics|I. Grabec|Redundancy of experimental data is the basic statistic from which the complexity of a natural phenomenon and the proper number of experiments needed for its exploration can be estimated. The redundancy is expressed by the entropy of information pertaining to the probability density function of experimental variables. Since the calculation of entropy is inconvenient due to integration over a range of variables, an approximate expression for redundancy is derived that includes only a sum over the set of experimental data about these variables. The approximation makes feasible an efficient estimation of the redundancy of data along with the related experimental information and information cost function. From the experimental information the complexity of the phenomenon can be simply estimated, while the proper number of experiments needed for its exploration can be determined from the minimum of the cost function. The performance of the approximate estimation of these statistics is demonstrated on two-dimensional normally distributed random data.
163|Effective potentials for quasicrystals from ab-initio data|Peter Brommer and Franz G\"ahler (Institut f\"ur Theoretische und   Angewandte Physik, Universit\"at Stuttgart)|Classical effective potentials are indispensable for any large-scale atomistic simulations, and the relevance of simulation results crucially depends on the quality of the potentials used. For complex alloys like quasicrystals, however, realistic effective potentials are practically inexistent. We report here on our efforts to develop effective potentials especially for quasicrystalline alloy systems. We use the so-called force matching method, in which the potential parameters are adapted so as to optimally reproduce the forces and energies in a set of suitably chosen reference configurations. These reference data are calculated with ab-initio methods. As a first application, EAM potentials for decagonal Al-Ni-Co, icosahedral Ca-Cd, and both icosahedral and decagonal Mg-Zn quasicrystals have been constructed. The influence of the potential range and degree of specialisation on the accuracy and other properties is discussed and compared.
164|On smooth foliations with Morse singularities|Lilia Rosati|Let $M$ be a smooth manifold and let $\F$ be a codimension one, $C^\infty$ foliation on $M$, with isolated singularities of Morse type. The study and classification of pairs $(M,\F)$ is a challenging (and difficult) problem. In this setting, a classical result due to Reeb \cite{Reeb} states that a manifold admitting a foliation with exactly two center-type singularities is a sphere. In particular this is true if the foliation is given by a function. Along these lines a result due to Eells and Kuiper \cite{Ku-Ee} classify manifolds having a real-valued function admitting exactly three non-degenerate singular points. In the present paper, we prove a generalization of the above mentioned results. To do this, we first describe the possible arrangements of pairs of singularities and the corresponding codimension one invariant sets, and then we give an elimination procedure for suitable center-saddle and some saddle-saddle configurations (of consecutive indices). In the second part, we investigate if other classical results, such as Haefliger and Novikov (Compact Leaf) theorems, proved for regular foliations, still hold true in presence of singularities. At this purpose, in the singular set, $Sing(\F)$ of the foliation $\F$, we consider {\em{weakly stable}} components, that we define as those components admitting a neighborhood where all leaves are compact. If $Sing(\F)$ admits only weakly stable components, given by smoothly embedded curves diffeomorphic to $S^1$, we are able to extend Haefliger's theorem. Finally, the existence of a closed curve, transverse to the foliation, leads us to state a Novikov-type result.
165|Frobenius-Schur indicators for semisimple Lie algebras|Mohammad Abu-Hamed and Shlomo Gelaki|Let g be a finite dimensional complex semisimple Lie algebra, and let V be a finite dimensional represenation of g. We give a closed formula for the mth Frobenius-Schur indicator, m>1, of V in representation-theoretic terms. We deduce that the indicators take integer values, and that for a large enough m, the mth indicator of V equals the dimension of the zero weight space of V. For the classical Lie algebras sl(n), so(2n), so(2n+1) and sp(2n), this is the case for m greater or equal to 2n-1, 4n-5, 4n-3 and 2n+1, respectively.
166|Supersymmetry breaking metastable vacua in runaway quiver gauge theories|Inaki Garcia-Etxebarria, Fouad Saad, Angel M. Uranga|In this paper we consider quiver gauge theories with fractional branes whose infrared dynamics removes the classical supersymmetric vacua (DSB branes). We show that addition of flavors to these theories (via additional non-compact branes) leads to local meta-stable supersymmetry breaking minima, closely related to those of SQCD with massive flavors. We simplify the study of the one-loop lifting of the accidental classical flat directions by direct computation of the pseudomoduli masses via Feynman diagrams. This new approach allows to obtain analytic results for all these theories. This work extends the results for the $dP_1$ theory in hep-th/0607218. The new approach allows to generalize the computation to general examples of DSB branes, and for arbitrary values of the superpotential couplings.
167|Low Energy Aspects of Heavy Meson Decays|Jan O. Eeg|I discuss low energy aspects of heavy meson decays, where there is at least one heavy meson in the final state. Examples are $B -\bar{B}$ mixing, $B \to D \bar{D}$, $B \to D \eta'$, and $B \to D \gamma$. %and $B \to D W $ (Isgur-Wise function). The analysis is performed in the heavy quark limit within heavy-light chiral perturbation theory. Coefficients of $1/N_c$ suppressed chiral Lagrangian terms (beyond factorization) have been estimated by means of a heavy-light chiral quark model.
168|Radiative losses and cut-offs of energetic particles at relativistic   shocks|Paul Dempsey and Peter Duffy|We investigate the acceleration and simultaneous radiative losses of electrons in the vicinity of relativistic shocks. Particles undergo pitch angle diffusion, gaining energy as they cross the shock by the Fermi mechanism and also emitting synchrotron radiation in the ambient magnetic field. A semi-analytic approach is developed which allows us to consider the behaviour of the shape of the spectral cut-off and the variation of that cut-off with the particle pitch angle. The implications for the synchrotron emission of relativistic jets, such as those in gamma ray burst sources and blazars, are discussed.
169|Very strong and slowly varying magnetic fields as source of axions|Giorgio Calucci|The investigation on the production of particles in slowly varying but extremely intense magnetic field in extended to the case of axions. The motivation is, as for some previously considered cases, the possibility that such kind of magnetic field may exist around very compact astrophysical objects.
170|Symmetry disquisition on the TiOX phase diagram|Daniele Fausti, Tom T. A. Lummen, Cosmina Angelescu, Roberto Macovez,   Javier Luzon, Ria Broer, Petra Rudolf, Paul H.M. van Loosdrecht, Natalia   Tristan, Bernd Buchner, Sander van Smaalen, Angela Moller, Gerd Meyer, Timo   Taetz|The sequence of phase transitions and the symmetry of in particular the low temperature incommensurate and spin-Peierls phases of the quasi one-dimensional inorganic spin-Peierls system TiOX (TiOBr and TiOCl) have been studied using inelastic light scattering experiments. The anomalous first-order character of the transition to the spin-Peierls phase is found to be a consequence of the different symmetries of the incommensurate and spin-Peierls (P$2_{1}/m$) phases.   The pressure dependence of the lowest transition temperature strongly suggests that magnetic interchain interactions play an important role in the formation of the spin-Peierls and the incommensurate phases. Finally, a comparison of Raman data on VOCl to the TiOX spectra shows that the high energy scattering observed previously has a phononic origin.
171|Discovery of a point-like very-high-energy gamma-ray source in Monoceros|F. Aharonian, et al|The complex Monoceros Loop SNR/Rosette Nebula region contains several potential sources of very-high-energy (VHE) gamma-ray emission and two as yet unidentified high-energy EGRET sources. Sensitive VHE observations are required to probe acceleration processes in this region. The H.E.S.S. telescope array has been used to search for very high-energy gamma-ray sources in this region. CO data from the NANTEN telescope were used to map the molecular clouds in the region, which could act as target material for gamma-ray production via hadronic interactions. We announce the discovery of a new gamma-ray source, HESS J0632+058, located close to the rim of the Monoceros SNR. This source is unresolved by H.E.S.S. and has no clear counterpart at other wavelengths but is possibly associated with the weak X-ray source 1RXS J063258.3+054857, the Be-star MWC 148 and/or the lower energy gamma-ray source 3EG J0634+0521. No evidence for an associated molecular cloud was found in the CO data.
172|Thermal entanglement of qubit pairs on the Shastry-Sutherland lattice|S. El Shawish, A. Ramsak, and J. Bonca|We show that temperature and magnetic field properties of the entanglement between spins on the two-dimensional Shastry-Sutherland lattice can be qualitatively described by analytical results for a qubit tetramer. Exact diagonalization of clusters with up to 20 sites reveals that the regime of fully entangled neighboring pairs coincides with the regime of finite spin gap in the spectrum. Additionally, the results for the regime of vanishing spin gap are discussed and related to the Heisenberg limit of the model.
173|Bonding of H in O vacancies of ZnO|H. Takenaka and D.J. Singh|We investigate the bonding of H in O vacancies of ZnO using density functional calculations. We find that H is anionic and does not form multicenter bonds with Zn in this compound.
174|Reparametrization Invariance, the controversial extraction of $\alpha$   from $B\to\pi\pi$ and New Physics|Francisco J. Botella (Valencia U. & Valencia U., IFIC), Miguel Nebot   (Lisbon, IST)|The extraction of the weak phase $\alpha$ from $B\to\pi\pi$ decays has been controversial from a statistical point of view, as the frequentist vs. bayesian confrontation shows. We analyse several relevant questions which have not deserved full attention and pervade the extraction of $\alpha$. Reparametrization Invariance proves appropriate to understand those issues. We show that some Standard Model inspired parametrizations can be senseless or inadequate if they go beyond the minimal Gronau and London assumptions: the single weak phase $\alpha$ just in the $\Delta I=3/2$ amplitudes, the isospin relations and experimental data. Beside those analyses, we extract $\alpha$ through the use of several adequate parametrizations, showing that there is no relevant discrepancy between frequentist and bayesian results. The most relevant information, in terms of $\alpha$, is the exclusion of values around $\alpha\sim \pi/4$; this result is valid in the presence of arbitrary New Physics contributions to the $\Delta I=1/2$ piece.
175|Solar System Constraints on Gauss-Bonnet Mediated Dark Energy|Luca Amendola, Christos Charmousis and Stephen C. Davis|Although the Gauss-Bonnet term is a topological invariant for general relativity, it couples naturally to a quintessence scalar field, modifying gravity at solar system scales. We determine the solar system constraints due to this term by evaluating the post-Newtonian metric for a distributional source. We find a mass dependent, 1/r^7 correction to the Newtonian potential, and also deviations from the Einstein gravity prediction for light-bending. We constrain the parameters of the theory using planetary orbits, the Cassini spacecraft data, and a laboratory test of Newton's law, always finding extremely tight bounds on the energy associated to the Gauss-Bonnet term. We discuss the relevance of these constraints to late-time cosmological acceleration.
176|Switching mechanism of photochromic diarylethene derivatives molecular   junctions|Jing Huang, Qunxiang Li, Hao Ren, Haibin Su, Q. W. Shi, and Jinlong   Yang|The electronic transport properties and switching mechanism of single photochromic diarylethene derivatives sandwiched between two gold surfaces with closed and open configurations are investigated by a fully self-consistent nonequilibrium Green's function method combined with density functional theory. The calculated transmission spectra of two configurations are strikingly distinctive. The open form lacks any significant transmission peak within a wide energy window, while the closed structure has two significant transmission peaks on the both sides of the Fermi level. The electronic transport properties of the molecular junction with closed structure under a small bias voltage are mainly determined by the tail of the transmission peak contributed unusually by the perturbed lowest perturbed unoccupied molecular orbital. The calculated on-off ratio of currents between the closed and open configurations is about two orders of magnitude, which reproduces the essential features of the experimental measured results. Moreover, we find that the switching behavior within a wide bias voltage window is extremely robust to both substituting F or S for H or O and varying end anchoring atoms from S to Se and Te.
177|Robust manipulation of electron spin coherence in an ensemble of singly   charged quantum dots|A. Greilich (1), M. Wiemann (1), F. G. G. Hernandez (1), D. R.   Yakovlev (1), I. A. Yugova (1), A. Shabaev (2), Al. L. Efros (2), D. Reuter   (3), A. D. Wieck (3), and M. Bayer (1) ((1) Universit\"at Dortmund, Germany,   (2) Washington, USA, (3) Ruhr-Universit\"at Bochum, Germany)|Using the recently reported mode locking effect we demonstrate a highly robust control of electron spin coherence in an ensemble of (In,Ga)As quantum dots during the single spin coherence time. The spin precession in a transverse magnetic field can be fully controlled up to 25 K by the parameters of the exciting pulsed laser protocol such as the pulse train sequence, leading to adjustable quantum beat bursts in Faraday rotation. Flipping of the electron spin precession phase was demonstrated by inverting the polarization within a pulse doublet sequence.
178|Equation of state for dense hydrogen and plasma phase transition|Bastian Holst, Nadine Nettelmann, Ronald Redmer|We calculate the equation of state of dense hydrogen within the chemical picture. Fluid variational theory is generalized for a multi-component system of molecules, atoms, electrons, and protons. Chemical equilibrium is supposed for the reactions dissociation and ionization. We identify the region of thermodynamic instability which is related to the plasma phase transition. The reflectivity is calculated along the Hugoniot curve and compared with experimental results. The equation-of-state data is used to calculate the pressure and temperature profiles for the interior of Jupiter.
179|Experimental nonclassicality of single-photon-added thermal light states|Alessandro Zavatta, Valentina Parigi, and Marco Bellini|We report the experimental realization and tomographic analysis of novel quantum light states obtained by exciting a classical thermal field by a single photon. Such states, although completely incoherent, possess a tunable degree of quantumness which is here exploited to put to a stringent experimental test some of the criteria proposed for the proof and the measurement of state non-classicality. The quantum character of the states is also given in quantum information terms by evaluating the amount of entanglement that they can produce.
180|Neutron Skin and Giant Resonances in Nuclei|Vadim Rodin|Some aspects, both experimental and theoretical, of extracting the neutron skin $\Delta R$ from properties of isovector giant resonances are discussed. Existing proposals are critically reviewed. The method relying on the energy difference between the GTR and IAS is shown to lack sensitivity to $\Delta R$. A simple explanation of the linear relation between the symmetry energy and the neutron skin is also given.
181|Genetic Optimization of Photonic Bandgap Structures|Joel Goh, Ilya Fushman, Dirk Englund, and Jelena Vuckovic|We investigate the use of a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to design a set of photonic crystals (PCs) in one and two dimensions. Our flexible design methodology allows us to optimize PC structures which are optimized for specific objectives. In this paper, we report the results of several such GA-based PC optimizations. We show that the GA performs well even in very complex design spaces, and therefore has great potential for use as a robust design tool in present and future applications.
182|Huge magneto-crystalline anisotropy of x-ray linear dichroism observed   on Co/FeMn bilayers|W. Kuch, F. Offi, L. I. Chelaru, J. Wang, K. Fukumoto, M. Kotsugi, J.   Kirschner, J. Kunes|We present an x-ray spectromicroscopic investigation of single-crystalline magnetic FeMn/Co bilayers on Cu(001), using X-ray magnetic circular (XMCD) and linear (XMLD) dichroism at the Co and Fe L3 absorption edges in combination with photoelectron emission microscopy (PEEM). Using the magnetic coupling between the ferromagnetic Co layer and the antiferromagnetic FeMn layer we are able to produce magnetic domains with two different crystallographic orientations of the magnetic easy axis within the same sample at the same time. We find a huge difference in the XMLD contrast between the two types of magnetic domains, which we discuss in terms of intrinsic magneto-crystalline anisotropy of XMLD of the Co layer. We also demonstrate that due to the high sensitivity of the method, the small number of induced ferromagnetic Fe moments at the FeMn-Co interface is sufficient to obtain magnetic contrast from XMLD in a metallic system.
183|Temperature Dependence of the Tensile Properties of Single Walled Carbon   Nanotubes: O(N) Tight Binding MD Simulation|G. Dereli and B. Sungu (Yildiz Tech. Univ., Istanbul)|This paper examines the effect of temperature on the structural stability and mechanical properties of 20 layered (10,10) single walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) under tensile loading using an O(N) tight binding molecular dynamics (TBMD) simulation method. We observed that (10,10) tube can sustain its structural stability for the strain values of 0.23 in elongation and 0.06 in compression at 300K. Bond breaking strain value decreases with increasing temperature under streching but not under compression. The elastic limit, Young's modulus, tensile strength and Poisson ratio are calculated as 0.10, 0.395 TPa, 83.23 GPa, 0.285, respectively, at 300K. In the temperature range from 300K to 900K; Young's modulus and the tensile strengths are decreasing with increasing temperature while the Poisson ratio is increasing. At higher temperatures, Young's modulus starts to increase while the Poisson ratio and tensile strength decrease. In the temperature range from 1200K to 1800K, the SWCNT is already deformed and softened. Applying strain on these deformed and softened SWCNTs do not follow the same pattern as in the temperature range of 300K to 900K.
184|Gamma-ray emitting AGN and GLAST|P. Padovani (ESO)|I describe the different classes of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) and the basic tenets of unified schemes. I then review the properties of the extragalactic sources detected in the GeV and TeV bands, showing that the vast majority of them belong to the very rare blazar class. I further discuss the kind of AGN GLAST is likely to detect, making some predictions going from the obvious to the likely, all the way to the less probable.
185|Potfit: effective potentials from ab-initio data|Peter Brommer and Franz G\"ahler (Institut f\"ur Theoretische und   Angewandte Physik, Universit\"at Stuttgart)|We present a program called potfit which generates an effective atomic interaction potential by matching it to a set of reference data computed in first-principles calculations. It thus allows to perform large-scale atomistic simulations of materials with physically justified potentials. We describe the fundamental principles behind the program, emphasizing its flexibility in adapting to different systems and potential models, while also discussing its limitations. The program has been used successfully in creating effective potentials for a number of complex intermetallic alloys, notably quasicrystals.
186|Dark energy and neutrino model in SUSY -- Remarks on active and sterile   neutrinos mixing --|Ryo Takahashi and Morimitsu Tanimoto|We consider a Mass Varying Neutrinos (MaVaNs) model in supersymmetric theory. The model includes effects of supersymmetry breaking transmitted by the gravitational interaction from the hidden sector, in which supersymmetry was broken, to the dark energy sector. Then evolutions of the neutrino mass and the equation of state parameter of the dark energy are presented in the model. It is remarked that only the mass of a sterile neutrino is variable in the case of the vanishing mixing between the left-handed and a sterile neutrino on cosmological time scale. The finite mixing makes the mass of the left-handed neutrino variable.
187|The transverse proximity effect in spectral hardness on the line of   sight towards HE 2347-4342|G. Worseck (1), C. Fechner (2,3), L. Wisotzki (1) and A. Dall'Aglio   (1) ((1) Astrophysikalisches Institut Potsdam, (2) Hamburger Sternwarte, (3)   Universit\"at Potsdam)|We report the discovery of 14 quasars in the vicinity of HE2347-4342, one of the two quasars whose intergalactic HeII forest has been resolved with FUSE. By analysing the HI and the HeII opacity variations separately, no transverse proximity effect is detected near three foreground quasars of HE2347-4342: QSOJ23503-4328 (z=2.282, $\vartheta=3.59$ arcmin), QSOJ23500-4319 (z=2.302, $\vartheta=8.77$ arcmin) and QSOJ23495-4338 (z=2.690, $\vartheta=16.28$ arcmin). This is primarily due to line contamination and overdensities probably created by large-scale structure. By comparing the HI absorption and the corresponding HeII absorption, we estimated the fluctuating spectral shape of the extragalactic UV radiation field along this line of sight. We find that the UV spectral shape near HE2347-4342 and in the projected vicinity of the three foreground quasars is statistically harder than expected from UV background models dominated by quasars. In addition, we find three highly ionised metal line systems near the quasars. However, they do not yield further constraints on the shape of the ionising field. We conclude that the foreground quasars show a transverse proximity effect that is detectable as a local hardening of the UV radiation field, although the evidence is strongest for QSOJ23495-4338. Thus, the relative spectral hardness traces the proximity effect also in overdense regions prohibiting the traditional detection in the HI forest. Furthermore, we emphasise that softening of quasar radiation by radiative transfer in the intergalactic medium is important to understand the observed spectral shape variations. From the transverse proximity effect of QSOJ23495-4338 we obtain a lower limit on the quasar lifetime of ~25 Myr.
188|Biased random walks on combs|Tanya M Elliott and John F Wheater|We develop rigorous, analytic techniques to study the behaviour of biased random walks on combs. This enables us to calculate exactly the spectral dimension of random comb ensembles for any bias scenario in the teeth or spine. Two specific examples of random comb ensembles are discussed; the random comb with nonzero probability of an infinitely long tooth at each vertex on the spine and the random comb with a power law distribution of tooth lengths. We also analyze transport properties along the spine for these probability measures.
189|Monoid generalizations of the Richard Thompson groups|J. C. Birget|The groups G_{k,1} of Richard Thompson and Graham Higman can be generalized in a natural way to monoids, that we call M_{k,1}, and to inverse monoids, called Inv_{k,1}; this is done by simply generalizing bijections to partial functions or partial injective functions. The monoids M_{k,1} have connections with circuit complexity (studied in another paper). Here we prove that M_{k,1} and Inv_{k,1} are congruence-simple for all k. Their Green relations J and D are characterized: M_{k,1} and Inv_{k,1} are J-0-simple, and they have k-1 non-zero D-classes. They are submonoids of the multiplicative part of the Cuntz algebra O_k. They are finitely generated, and their word problem over any finite generating set is in P. Their word problem is coNP-complete over certain infinite generating sets.   Changes in this version: Section 4 has been thoroughly revised, and errors have been corrected; however, the main results of Section 4 do not change. Sections 1, 2, and 3 are unchanged, except for the proof of Theorem 2.3, which was incomplete; a complete proof was published in the Appendix of reference [6], and is also given here.
190|The Reliability on the Direction of the Incident Neutrino for the Fully   Contained Events and Partially Contained Events due to QEL in the   Super-Kamiokande|E. Konishi (1), Y. Minorikawa (2), V.I. Galkin (3), M. Ishiwata (4),   I. Nakamura (4), N. Takahashit (1), M. Kato (5) and A. Misaki (6) ((1)   Graduate School of Science and Technology, Hirosaki University (2) School of   Science and Engineering, Kinki University (3) Department of Physics, Moscow   State University (4) Department of Physics, Saitama University (5) Kyowa   Interface Science Co., Ltd., Saitama (6)Advanced Research Institute for   Science and Engineering, Waseda University, Tokyo)|In the SK analysis of the neutrino events for [Fully Contained Events] and [Partially Contained Events] on their zenith angle distribution, it is assumed that the zenith angle of the incident neutrino is the same as that of the detected charged lepton. In the present paper, we examine the validity of [the SK assumption on the direction] of the incident neutrinos. Concretely speaking, we analyze muon-like events due to QEL. For the purpose, we develop [Time Sequential Monte Carlo Simulation] to extract the conclusion on the validity of the SK assumption. In our [Time Sequential Simulation], we simulate every physical process concerned as exactly as possible without any approximation.   From the comparison between the zenith angle distributon of the emitted muons under [the SK assumption on the direction] and the corresponding one obtained under our [Time Sequential Simulation], it is concluded that the measurement of the direction of the incident neutrino for the neutrino events occurring inside the detector in the SK analysis turns out to be unreliable, which holds irrespective of the existence and/or non-existence of the neutrino oscillation.
191|Intricate Knots in Proteins: Function and Evolution|Peter Virnau (1), Leonid A. Mirny (1,2), Mehran Kardar (1) ((1)   Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Department of Physics, Cambridge, MA,   United States of America, (2) Massachusetts Institute of Technology,   Harvard-MIT Division of Health Science and Technology, Cambridge, MA, United   States of America)|A number of recently discovered protein structures incorporate a rather unexpected structural feature: a knot in the polypeptide backbone. These knots are extremely rare, but their occurrence is likely connected to protein function in as yet unexplored fashion. Our analysis of the complete Protein Data Bank reveals several new knots which, along with previously discovered ones, can shed light on such connections. In particular, we identify the most complex knot discovered to date in human ubiquitin hydrolase, and suggest that its entangled topology protects it against unfolding and degradation by the proteasome. Knots in proteins are typically preserved across species and sometimes even across kingdoms. However, we also identify a knot which only appears in some transcarbamylases while being absent in homologous proteins of similar structure. The emergence of the knot is accompanied by a shift in the enzymatic function of the protein. We suggest that the simple insertion of a short DNA fragment into the gene may suffice to turn an unknotted into a knotted structure in this protein.
192|Star Formation in Galaxies with Large Lower Surface Brightness Disks|K. O'Neil, S. Oey, G. Bothun|We present B, R, and Halpha imaging data of 19 large disk galaxies whose properties are intermediate between classical low surface brightness galaxies and ordinary high surface brightness galaxies. We use data taken from the Lowell 1.8m Perkins telescope to determine the galaxies' overall morphology, color, and star formation properties. Morphologically, the galaxies range from Sb through Irr and include galaxies with and without nuclear bars. The colors of the galaxies vary from B-R = 0.3 - 1.9, and most show at least a slight bluing of the colors with increasing radius. The Halpha images of these galaxies show an average star formation rate lower than is found for similar samples with higher surface brightness disks. Additionally, the galaxies studied have both higher gas mass-to-luminosity and diffuse Halpha emission than is found in higher surface brightness samples.
193|Domain Wall Dynamics near a Quantum Critical Point|Shengjun Yuan, Hans De Raedt, Seiji Miyashita|We study the real-time domain-wall dynamics near a quantum critical point of the one-dimensional anisotropic ferromagnetic spin 1/2 chain. By numerical simulation, we find the domain wall is dynamically stable in the Heisenberg-Ising model. Near the quantum critical point, the width of the domain wall diverges as $(\Delta -1) ^{-1/2}$.
194|Quantum mechanical approach to decoherence and relaxation generated by   fluctuating environment|S.A. Gurvitz and D. Mozyrsky|We consider an electrostatic qubit, interacting with a fluctuating charge of single electron transistor (SET) in the framework of exactly solvable model. The SET plays a role of the fluctuating environment affecting the qubit's parameters in a controllable way. We derive the rate equations describing dynamics of the entire system for both weak and strong qubit-SET coupling. Solving these equation we obtain decoherence and relaxation rates of the qubit, as well as the spectral density of the fluctuating qubit's parameters. We found that in the weak coupling regime the decoherence and relaxation rates are directly related to the spectral density taken at Rabi or at zero frequency, depending on what a particular qubit's parameters is fluctuating. This relation holds also in the presence of weak back-action of the qubit on the fluctuating environment. In the case of strong back-action, such simple relationship no longer holds, even if the qubit-SET coupling is small. It does not hold either in the strong-coupling regime, even in the absence of the back-action. In addition, we found that our model predicts localization of the qubit in the strong-coupling regime, resembling that of the spin-boson model.
195|Group-theoretical properties of nilpotent modular categories|Vladimir Drinfeld, Shlomo Gelaki, Dmitri Nikshych, Victor Ostrik|We characterize a natural class of modular categories of prime power Frobenius-Perron dimension as representation categories of twisted doubles of finite p-groups. We also show that a nilpotent braided fusion category C admits an analogue of the Sylow decomposition. If the simple objects of C have integral Frobenius-Perron dimensions then C is group-theoretical. As a consequence, we obtain that semisimple quasi-Hopf algebras of prime power dimension are group-theoretical. Our arguments are based on a reconstruction of twisted group doubles from Lagrangian subcategories of modular categories (this is reminiscent to the characterization of doubles of quasi-Lie bialgebras in terms of Manin pairs).
196|Remarks on N_c dependence of decays of exotic baryons|Karolina Piesciuk, Michal Praszalowicz|We calculate the N_c dependence of the decay widths of exotic eikosiheptaplet within the framework of Chral Quark Soliton Model. We also discuss generalizations of regular baryon representations for arbitrary N_c.
197|Analysis of random Boolean networks using the average sensitivity|Steffen Schober and Martin Bossert|In this work we consider random Boolean networks that provide a general model for genetic regulatory networks. We extend the analysis of James Lynch who was able to proof Kauffman's conjecture that in the ordered phase of random networks, the number of ineffective and freezing gates is large, where as in the disordered phase their number is small. Lynch proved the conjecture only for networks with connectivity two and non-uniform probabilities for the Boolean functions. We show how to apply the proof to networks with arbitrary connectivity $K$ and to random networks with biased Boolean functions. It turns out that in these cases Lynch's parameter $\lambda$ is equivalent to the expectation of average sensitivity of the Boolean functions used to construct the network. Hence we can apply a known theorem for the expectation of the average sensitivity. In order to prove the results for networks with biased functions, we deduct the expectation of the average sensitivity when only functions with specific connectivity and specific bias are chosen at random.
198|Theory of polariton mediated Raman scattering in microcavities|L. M. Leon Hilario, A. Bruchhausen, A. M. Lobos, A. A. Aligia|We calculate the intensity of the polariton mediated inelastic light scattering in semiconductor microcavities. We treat the exciton-photon coupling nonperturbatively and incorporate lifetime effects in both excitons and photons, and a coupling of the photons to the electron-hole continuum. Taking the matrix elements as fitting parameters, the results are in excellent agreement with measured Raman intensities due to optical phonons resonant with the upper polariton branches in II-VI microcavities with embedded CdTe quantum wells.
199|Decomposition numbers for finite Coxeter groups and generalised   non-crossing partitions|Christian Krattenthaler (Universit\"at Wien) and Thomas M\"uller   (Queen Mary & Westfield College, University of London)|Given a finite irreducible Coxeter group $W$, a positive integer $d$, and types $T_1,T_2,...,T_d$ (in the sense of the classification of finite Coxeter groups), we compute the number of decompositions $c=\si_1\si_2 cdots\si_d$ of a Coxeter element $c$ of $W$, such that $\si_i$ is a Coxeter element in a subgroup of type $T_i$ in $W$, $i=1,2,...,d$, and such that the factorisation is "minimal" in the sense that the sum of the ranks of the $T_i$'s, $i=1,2,...,d$, equals the rank of $W$. For the exceptional types, these decomposition numbers have been computed by the first author. The type $A_n$ decomposition numbers have been computed by Goulden and Jackson, albeit using a somewhat different language. We explain how to extract the type $B_n$ decomposition numbers from results of B\'ona, Bousquet, Labelle and Leroux on map enumeration. Our formula for the type $D_n$ decomposition numbers is new. These results are then used to determine, for a fixed positive integer $l$ and fixed integers $r_1\le r_2\le ...\le r_l$, the number of multi-chains $\pi_1\le \pi_2\le ...\le \pi_l$ in Armstrong's generalised non-crossing partitions poset, where the poset rank of $\pi_i$ equals $r_i$, and where the "block structure" of $\pi_1$ is prescribed. We demonstrate that this result implies all known enumerative results on ordinary and generalised non-crossing partitions via appropriate summations. Surprisingly, this result on multi-chain enumeration is new even for the original non-crossing partitions of Kreweras. Moreover, the result allows one to solve the problem of rank-selected chain enumeration in the type $D_n$ generalised non-crossing partitions poset, which, in turn, leads to a proof of Armstrong's $F=M$ Conjecture in type $D_n$.
200|Electromagnetic polarizabilities and the excited states of the nucleon|Martin Schumacher|The electromagnetic polarizabilities of the nucleon are shown to be essentially composed of the nonresonant $\alpha_p(E_{0+})=+3.2$, $\alpha_n(E_{0+})=+4.1$,the $t$-channel $\alpha^t_{p,n}=-\beta^t_{p,n}=+7.6$ and the resonant $\beta_{p,n}(P_{33}(1232))=+8.3$ contributions (in units of $10^{-4}$fm$^3$. The remaining deviations from the experimental data $\Delta\alpha_p=1.2\pm 0.6$, $\Delta\beta_p=1.2\mp 0.6$, \Delta\alpha_n=0.8\pm 1.7$ and $\Delta\beta_n=2.0\mp 1.8$ are contributed by a larger number of resonant and nonresonant processes with cancellations between the contributions. This result confirms that dominant contributions to the electric and magnetic polarizabilities may be represented in terms of two-photon couplings to the $\sigma$-meson having the predicted mass $m_\sigma=666$ MeV and two-photon width $\Gamma_{\gamma\gamma}=2.6$ keV.
201|Hecke-Clifford algebras and spin Hecke algebras I: the classical affine   type|Ta Khongsap, Weiqiang Wang|Associated to the classical Weyl groups, we introduce the notion of degenerate spin affine Hecke algebras and affine Hecke-Clifford algebras. For these algebras, we establish the PBW properties, formulate the intertwiners, and describe the centers. We further develop connections of these algebras with the usual degenerate (i.e. graded) affine Hecke algebras of Lusztig by introducing a notion of degenerate covering affine Hecke algebras.
202|Towards Minimal Resources of Measurement-based Quantum Computation|Simon Perdrix|We improve the upper bound on the minimal resources required for measurement-based quantum computation. Minimizing the resources required for this model is a key issue for experimental realization of a quantum computer based on projective measurements. This new upper bound allows also to reply in the negative to the open question about the existence of a trade-off between observable and ancillary qubits in measurement-based quantum computation.
203|A Spitzer census of the IC 348 nebula|August A. Muench, Charles J. Lada, K. L. Luhman, James Muzerolle and   Erick Young|We present a Spitzer based census of the IC 348 nebula and embedded star cluster. Our Spitzer census supplemented by ground based spectra has added 42 class II T-Tauri sources to the cluster membership and identified ~20 class 0/I protostars. The population of IC 348 likely exceeds 400 sources after accounting statistically for unidentified diskless members. Our Spitzer census of IC 348 reveals a population of protostars that is anti-correlated spatially with the T-Tauri members, which comprise the centrally condensed cluster around a B star. The protostars are instead found mostly at the cluster periphery about 1 pc from the B star and spread out along a filamentary ridge. We find that the star formation rate in this protostellar ridge is consistent with that rate which built the exposed cluster while the presence of fifteen cold, starless, millimeter cores intermingled with this protostellar population indicates that the IC 348 nebula has yet to finish forming stars. We show that the IC 348 cluster is of order 3-5 crossing times old, and, as evidenced by its smooth radial profile and confirmed mass segregation, is likely relaxed. While it seems apparent that the current cluster configuration is the result of dynamical evolution and its primordial structure has been erased, our findings support a model where embedded clusters are built up from numerous smaller sub-clusters. Finally, the results of our Spitzer census indicate that the supposition that star formation must progress rapidly in a dark cloud should not preclude these observations that show it can be relatively long lived.
204|Non-Equilibrium Josephson and Andreev Current through Interacting   Quantum Dots|Marco G. Pala, Michele Governale, J\"urgen K\"onig|We present a theory of transport through interacting quantum dots coupled to normal and superconducting leads in the limit of weak tunnel coupling. A Josephson current between two superconducting leads, carried by first-order tunnel processes, can be established by non-equilibrium proximity effect. Both Andreev and Josephson current is suppressed for bias voltages below a threshold set by the Coulomb charging energy. A $\pi$-transition of the supercurrent can be driven by tuning gate or bias voltages.
205|Discovery of X-ray emission from the young radio pulsar PSR J1357-6429|P. Esposito, A. Tiengo, A. De Luca, F. Mattana|We present the first X-ray detection of the very young pulsar PSR J1357-6429 (characteristic age of 7.3 kyr) using data from the XMM-Newton and Chandra satellites. We find that the spectrum is well described by a power-law plus blackbody model, with photon index Gamma=1.4 and blackbody temperature kT=160 eV. For the estimated distance of 2.5 kpc, this corresponds to a 2-10 keV luminosity of about 1.2E+32 erg/s, thus the fraction of the spin-down energy channeled by PSR J1357-6429 into X-ray emission is one of the lowest observed. The Chandra data confirm the positional coincidence with the radio pulsar and allow to set an upper limit of 3E+31 erg/s on the 2-10 keV luminosity of a compact pulsar wind nebula. We do not detect any pulsed emission from the source and determine an upper limit of 30% for the modulation amplitude of the X-ray emission at the radio frequency of the pulsar.
206|Resonant activation in bistable semiconductor lasers|Stefano Lepri, Giovanni Giacomelli|We theoretically investigate the possibility of observing resonant activation in the hopping dynamics of two-mode semiconductor lasers. We present a series of simulations of a rate-equations model under random and periodic modulation of the bias current. In both cases, for an optimal choice of the modulation time-scale, the hopping times between the stable lasing modes attain a minimum. The simulation data are understood by means of an effective one-dimensional Langevin equation with multiplicative fluctuations. Our conclusions apply to both Edge Emitting and Vertical Cavity Lasers, thus opening the way to several experimental tests in such optical systems.
207|Quark matter and the astrophysics of neutron stars|M Prakash|Some of the means through which the possible presence of nearly deconfined quarks in neutron stars can be detected by astrophysical observations of neutron stars from their birth to old age are highlighted.
208|Some non-braided fusion categories of rank 3|Tobias J. Hagge and Seung-Moon Hong|We classify all fusion categories for a given set of fusion rules with three simple object types. If a conjecture of Ostrik is true, our classification completes the classification of fusion categories with three simple object types. To facilitate the discussion we describe a convenient, concrete and useful variation of graphical calculus for fusion categories, discuss pivotality and sphericity in this framework, and give a short and elementary re-proof of the fact that the quadruple dual functor is naturally isomorphic to the identity.
209|Chandra Observations of Supernova 1987A|Sangwook Park, David N. Burrows, Gordon P. Garmire (Penn State),   Richard McCray (Colorado), Judith L. Racusin (Penn State), Svetozar A. Zhekov   (Space Res Inst)|We have been monitoring Supernova (SN) 1987A with {\it Chandra X-Ray Observatory} since 1999. We present a review of previous results from our {\it Chandra} observations, and some preliminary results from new {\it Chandra} data obtained in 2006 and 2007. High resolution imaging and spectroscopic studies of SN 1987A with {\it Chandra} reveal that X-ray emission of SN 1987A originates from the hot gas heated by interaction of the blast wave with the ring-like dense circumstellar medium (CSM) that was produced by the massive progenitor's equatorial stellar winds before the SN explosion. The blast wave is now sweeping through dense CSM all around the inner ring, and thus SN 1987A is rapidly brightening in soft X-rays. At the age of 20 yr (as of 2007 January), X-ray luminosity of SN 1987A is $L_{\rm X}$ $\sim$ 2.4 $\times$ 10$^{36}$ ergs s$^{-1}$ in the 0.5$-$10 keV band. X-ray emission is described by two-component plane shock model with electron temperatures of $kT$ $\sim$ 0.3 and 2 keV. As the shock front interacts with dense CSM all around the inner ring, the X-ray remnant is now expanding at a much slower rate of $v$ $\sim$ 1400 km s$^{-1}$ than it was until 2004 ($v$ $\sim$ 6000 km s$^{-1}$).
210|Classification of superpotentials|Andrew Dancer, Mckenzie Wang|We extend our previous classification of superpotentials of ``scalar curvature type" for the cohomogeneity one Ricci-flat equations. We now consider the case not covered in our previous paper, i.e., when some weight vector of the superpotential lies outside (a scaled translate of) the convex hull of the weight vectors associated with the scalar curvature function of the principal orbit. In this situation we show that either the isotropy representation has at most 3 irreducible summands or the first order subsystem associated to the superpotential is of the same form as the Calabi-Yau condition for submersion type metrics on complex line bundles over a Fano K\"ahler-Einstein product.
211|Linkedness and ordered cycles in digraphs|Daniela K\"uhn and Deryk Osthus|The minimum semi-degree of a digraph D is the minimum of its minimum outdegree and its minimum indegree. We show that every sufficiently large digraph D with minimum semi-degree at least n/2 +k-1 is k-linked. The bound on the minimum semi-degree is best possible and confirms a conjecture of Manoussakis from 1990. We also determine the smallest minimum semi-degree which ensures that a sufficiently large digraph D is k-ordered, i.e. that for every ordered sequence of k distinct vertices of D there is a directed cycle which encounters these vertices in this order.
212|Curvature and isocurvature perturbations in two-field inflation|Z. Lalak, D. Langlois, S. Pokorski, K. Turzynski|We study cosmological perturbations in two-field inflation, allowing for non-standard kinetic terms. We calculate analytically the spectra of curvature and isocurvature modes at Hubble crossing, up to first order in the slow-roll parameters. We also compute numerically the evolution of the curvature and isocurvature modes from well within the Hubble radius until the end of inflation. We show explicitly for a few examples, including the recently proposed model of `roulette' inflation, how isocurvature perturbations affect significantly the curvature perturbation between Hubble crossing and the end of inflation.

214|A schematic model of scattering in PT-symmetric Quantum Mechanics|Miloslav Znojil|One-dimensional scattering problem admitting a complex, PT-symmetric short-range potential V(x) is considered. Using a Runge-Kutta-discretized version of Schroedinger equation we derive the formulae for the reflection and transmission coefficients and emphasize that the only innovation emerges in fact via a complexification of one of the potential-characterizing parameters.
215|The exact asymptotic of the collision time tail distribution for   independent Brownian particles with different drifts|Zbigniew Pucha{\l}a and Tomasz Rolski|In this note we consider the time of the collision $\tau$ for $n$ independent Brownian motions $X^1_t,...,X_t^n$ with drifts $a_1,...,a_n$, each starting from $x=(x_1,...,x_n)$, where $x_1<...<x_n$. We show the exact asymptotics of $P_x(\tau>t) = C h(x)t^{-\alpha}e^{-\gamma t}(1 + o(1))$ as $t\to\infty$ and identify $C,h(x),\alpha,\gamma$ in terms of the drifts.
216|Ab initio Study of Graphene on SiC|Alexander Mattausch and Oleg Pankratov|Employing density-functional calculations we study single and double graphene layers on Si- and C-terminated 1x1-6H-SiC surfaces. We show that, in contrast to earlier assumptions, the first carbon layer is covalently bonded to the substrate, and cannot be responsible for the graphene-type electronic spectrum observed experimentally. The characteristic spectrum of free-standing graphene appears with the second carbon layer, which exhibits a weak van der Waals bonding to the underlying structure. For Si-terminated substrate, the interface is metallic, whereas on C-face it is semiconducting or semimetallic for single or double graphene coverage, respectively.
217|Capacity of a Multiple-Antenna Fading Channel with a Quantized Precoding   Matrix|Wiroonsak Santipach and Michael L. Honig|Given a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channel, feedback from the receiver can be used to specify a transmit precoding matrix, which selectively activates the strongest channel modes. Here we analyze the performance of Random Vector Quantization (RVQ), in which the precoding matrix is selected from a random codebook containing independent, isotropically distributed entries. We assume that channel elements are i.i.d. and known to the receiver, which relays the optimal (rate-maximizing) precoder codebook index to the transmitter using B bits. We first derive the large system capacity of beamforming (rank-one precoding matrix) as a function of B, where large system refers to the limit as B and the number of transmit and receive antennas all go to infinity with fixed ratios. With beamforming RVQ is asymptotically optimal, i.e., no other quantization scheme can achieve a larger asymptotic rate. The performance of RVQ is also compared with that of a simpler reduced-rank scalar quantization scheme in which the beamformer is constrained to lie in a random subspace. We subsequently consider a precoding matrix with arbitrary rank, and approximate the asymptotic RVQ performance with optimal and linear receivers (matched filter and Minimum Mean Squared Error (MMSE)). Numerical examples show that these approximations accurately predict the performance of finite-size systems of interest. Given a target spectral efficiency, numerical examples show that the amount of feedback required by the linear MMSE receiver is only slightly more than that required by the optimal receiver, whereas the matched filter can require significantly more feedback.
218|On Almost Periodicity Criteria for Morphic Sequences in Some Particular   Cases|Yuri Pritykin|In some particular cases we give criteria for morphic sequences to be almost periodic (=uniformly recurrent). Namely, we deal with fixed points of non-erasing morphisms and with automatic sequences. In both cases a polynomial-time algorithm solving the problem is found. A result more or less supporting the conjecture of decidability of the general problem is given.
219|The Radio Emission, X-ray Emission, and Hydrodynamics of G328.4+0.2: A   Comprehensive Analysis of a Luminous Pulsar Wind Nebula, its Neutron Star,   and the Progenitor Supernova Explosion|Joseph D. Gelfand, B. M. Gaensler, Patrick O. Slane, Daniel J.   Patnaude, John P. Hughes, Fernando Camilo|We present new observational results obtained for the Galactic non-thermal radio source G328.4+0.2 to determine both if this source is a pulsar wind nebula or supernova remnant, and in either case, the physical properties of this source. Using X-ray data obtained by XMM, we confirm that the X-ray emission from this source is heavily absorbed and has a spectrum best fit by a power law model of photon index=2 with no evidence for a thermal component, the X-ray emission from G328.4+0.2 comes from a region significantly smaller than the radio emission, and that the X-ray and radio emission are significantly offset from each other. We also present the results of a new high resolution (7 arcseconds) 1.4 GHz image of G328.4+0.2 obtained using the Australia Telescope Compact Array, and a deep search for radio pulsations using the Parkes Radio Telescope. We find that the radio emission has a flat spectrum, though some areas along the eastern edge of G328.4+0.2 have a steeper radio spectral index of ~-0.3. Additionally, we obtain a luminosity limit of the central pulsar of L_{1400} < 30 mJy kpc^2, assuming a distance of 17 kpc. In light of these observational results, we test if G328.4+0.2 is a pulsar wind nebula (PWN) or a large PWN inside a supernova remnant (SNR) using a simple hydrodynamic model for the evolution of a PWN inside a SNR. As a result of this analysis, we conclude that G328.4+0.2 is a young (< 10000 years old) pulsar wind nebula formed by a low magnetic field (<10^12 G) neutron star born spinning rapidly (<10 ms) expanding into an undetected SNR formed by an energetic (>10^51 ergs), low ejecta mass (M < 5 Solar Masses) supernova explosion which occurred in a low density (n~0.03 cm^{-3}) environment.
220|Three Particle Correlations from STAR|Jason Glyndwr Ulery (for the STAR Collaboration)|Two-particle correlations have shown modification to the away-side shape in central Au+Au collisions relative to $pp$, d+Au and peripheral Au+Au collisions. Different scenarios can explain this modification including: large angle gluon radiation, jets deflected by transverse flow, path length dependent energy loss, Cerenkov gluon radiation of fast moving particles, and conical flow generated by hydrodynamic Mach-cone shock-waves. Three-particle correlations have the power to distinguish the scenarios with conical emission, conical flow and Cerenkov radiation, from other scenarios. In addition, the dependence of the observed shapes on the $p_T$ of the associated particles can be used to distinguish conical emission from a sonic boom (Mach-cone) and from QCD-Cerenkov radiation. We present results from STAR on 3-particle azimuthal correlations for a high $p_T$ trigger particle with two softer particles. Results are shown for $pp$, d+Au and high statistics Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$=200 GeV. An important aspect of the analysis is the subtraction of combinatorial backgrounds. Systematic uncertainties due to this subtraction and the flow harmonics v2 and v4 are investigated in detail. The implications of the results for the presence or absence of conical flow from Mach-cones are discussed.
221|The Return of a Static Universe and the End of Cosmology|Lawrence M. Krauss (1,2) and Robert J. Scherrer (2) ((1) Case Western   Reserve University, (2) Vanderbilt University)|We demonstrate that as we extrapolate the current $\Lambda$CDM universe forward in time, all evidence of the Hubble expansion will disappear, so that observers in our "island universe" will be fundamentally incapable of determining the true nature of the universe, including the existence of the highly dominant vacuum energy, the existence of the CMB, and the primordial origin of light elements. With these pillars of the modern Big Bang gone, this epoch will mark the end of cosmology and the return of a static universe. In this sense, the coordinate system appropriate for future observers will perhaps fittingly resemble the static coordinate system in which the de Sitter universe was first presented.
222|Dark Matter annihilation in Draco: new considerations on the expected   gamma flux|Miguel A. Sanchez-Conde|A new estimation of the gamma-ray flux that we expect to detect from SUSY dark matter annihilation from the Draco dSph is presented using the DM density profiles compatible with the latest observations. This calculation takes also into account the important effect of the Point Spread Function (PSF) of the telescope. We show that this effect is crucial in the way we will observe and interpret a possible signal detection. Finally, we discuss the prospects to detect a possible gamma signal from Draco for MAGIC and GLAST.
223|Magnetohydrodynamic Rebound Shocks of Supernovae|Yu-Qing Lou (1,2,3) and Wei-Gang Wang (1), ((1) Tsinghua Center For   astrophysics, Tsinghua University, (2)The University of Chicago, (3) National   Astronomical Observatories, Chinese Academy of Science.)|We construct magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) similarity rebound shocks joining `quasi-static' asymptotic solutions around the central degenerate core to explore an MHD model for the evolution of random magnetic field in supernova explosions. This provides a theoretical basis for further studying synchrotron diagnostics, MHD shock acceleration of cosmic rays, and the nature of intense magnetic field in compact objects. The magnetic field strength in space approaches a limiting ratio, that is comparable to the ratio of the ejecta mass driven out versus the progenitor mass, during this self-similar rebound MHD shock evolution. The intense magnetic field of the remnant compact star as compared to that of the progenitor star is mainly attributed to both the gravitational core collapse and the radial distribution of magnetic field.
224|Are There Mach Cones in Heavy Ion Collisions? Three-Particle   Correlations from STAR|Jason Glyndwr Ulery (for the STAR Collaboration)|We present results from STAR on 3-particle azimuthal correlations for a $3<p_T<4$ GeV/c trigger particle with two softer $1<p_T<2$ GeV/c particles. Results are shown for pp, d+Au and high statistics Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=200 GeV$. We observe a 3-particle correlation in central Au+Au collisions which may indicate the presence of conical emission. In addition, the dependence of the observed signal angular position on the $p_T$ of the associated particles can be used to distinguish conical flow from simple QCD-\v{C}erenkov radiation. An important aspect of the analysis is the subtraction of combinatorial backgrounds. Systematic uncertainties due to this subtraction and the flow harmonics $v_2$ and $v_4$ are investigated in detail.
225|Exploring First Stars Era with GLAST|A. Kashlinsky and D. Band|Cosmic infrared background (CIB) includes emissions from objects inaccessible to current telescopic studies, such as the putative Population III, the first stars. Recently, strong direct evidence for significant CIB levels produced by the first stars came from CIB fluctuations discovered in deep Spitzer images. Such CIB levels should have left a unique absorption feature in the spectra of high-z GRBs and blazars as suggested in [4]. This is observable with GLAST sources at z>2 and measuring this absorption will give important information on energetics and constituents of the first stars era.
226|Correlated modulation between the redshifted Fe K alpha line and the   continuum emission in NGC 3783|F. Tombesi (1,2), B. De Marco (3), K. Iwasawa (4), M. Cappi (1), M.   Dadina (1), G. Ponti (1,2), G. Miniutti (5) and G.G.C. Palumbo (2) ((1)   INAF-IASF Bologna, (2) UNIBO, (3) SISSA, (4) MPE, (5) Institute of Astronomy,   Cambridge)|It has been suggested that X-ray observations of rapidly variable Seyfert galaxies may hold the key to probe the gas orbital motions in the innermost regions of accretion discs around black holes and, thus, trace flow patterns under the effect of the hole strong gravitational field. We explore this possibility analizing XMM-Newton observations of the seyfert 1 galaxy NGC 3783. A detiled time-resolved spectral analysis is performed down to the shortest possible time-scales (few ks) using "excess maps" and cross-correlating light curves in different energy bands. In addition to a constant core of the Fe K alpha line, we detected a variable and redshifted Fe K alpha emission feature between 5.3-6.1 keV. The line exhibits a modulation on a time-scale of 27 ks that is similar to and in phase with a modulation of the 0.3-10 keV source continuum. The time-scale of the correlated variability of the redshifted Fe line and continuum agrees with the local dynamical time-scale of the accretion disc at 10 r_g around a black hole of 10^7 M_sun. Given the shape of the redshfted line emission and the overall X-ray variability pattern, the line is likely to arise from the relativistic region near the black hole.
227|Isotopic Effects in Nuclear Reactions at Relativistic Energies|C.Sfienti, M. De Napoli, S. Bianchin, A.S. Botvina, J. Brzychczyk, A.   Le Fevre, J. Lukasik, P. Pawlowski, W. Trautmann and the ALADiN2000   Collaboration|A systematic study of isotopic effects in the break-up of projectile spectators at relativistic energies has been performed at the GSI laboratory with the ALADiN spectrometer coupled to the LAND neutron detector. Besides a primary beam of 124Sn, also secondary beams of 124La and 107Sn produced at the FRS fragment separator have been used in order to extend the range of isotopic compositions. The gross properties of projectile fragmentation are very similar for all the studied systems but specific isotopic effects have been observed in both neutron and charged particle production. The breakup temperatures obtained from the double ratios of isotopic yields have been extracted and compared with the limiting-temperature expectation.
228|Einstein vs Maxwell: Is gravitation a curvature of space, a field in   flat space, or both?|Theo M. Nieuwenhuizen|Starting with a field theoretic approach in Minkowski space, the gravitational energy momentum tensor is derived from the Einstein equations in a straightforward manner. This allows to present them as {\it acceleration tensor} = const. $\times$ {\it total energy momentum tensor}. For flat space cosmology the gravitational energy is negative and cancels the material energy. In the relativistic theory of gravitation a bimetric coupling between the Riemann and Minkowski metrics breaks general coordinate invariance. The case of a positive cosmological constant is considered. A singularity free version of the Schwarzschild black hole is solved analytically. In the interior the components of the metric tensor quickly die out, but do not change sign, leaving the role of time as usual. For cosmology the $\Lambda$CDM model is covered, while there appears a form of inflation at early times. Here both the total energy and the zero point energy vanish.
229|Geometric Complexity Theory VI: the flip via saturated and positive   integer programming in representation theory and algebraic geometry|Ketan D. Mulmuley|This article belongs to a series on geometric complexity theory (GCT), an approach to the P vs. NP and related problems through algebraic geometry and representation theory. The basic principle behind this approach is called the flip. In essence, it reduces the negative hypothesis in complexity theory (the lower bound problems), such as the P vs. NP problem in characteristic zero, to the positive hypothesis in complexity theory (the upper bound problems): specifically, to showing that the problems of deciding nonvanishing of the fundamental structural constants in representation theory and algebraic geometry, such as the well known plethysm constants--or rather certain relaxed forms of these decision probelms--belong to the complexity class P. In this article, we suggest a plan for implementing the flip, i.e., for showing that these relaxed decision problems belong to P. This is based on the reduction of the preceding complexity-theoretic positive hypotheses to mathematical positivity hypotheses: specifically, to showing that there exist positive formulae--i.e. formulae with nonnegative coefficients--for the structural constants under consideration and certain functions associated with them. These turn out be intimately related to the similar positivity properties of the Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials and the multiplicative structural constants of the canonical (global crystal) bases in the theory of Drinfeld-Jimbo quantum groups. The known proofs of these positivity properties depend on the Riemann hypothesis over finite fields and the related results. Thus the reduction here, in conjunction with the flip, in essence, says that the validity of the P vs. NP conjecture in characteristic zero is intimately linked to the Riemann hypothesis over finite fields and related problems.
230|Two new basaltic asteroids in the Outer Main Belt?|R. Duffard and F. Roig|The identification of basaltic asteroids in the asteroid Main Belt and the description of their surface mineralogy is necessary to understand the diversity in the collection of basaltic meteorites. Basaltic asteroids can be identified from their visible reflectance spectra and are classified as V-type in the usual taxonomies. In this work, we report visible spectroscopic observations of two candidate V-type asteroids, (7472) Kumakiri and (10537) 1991 RY16, located in the outer Main Belt (a > 2.85 UA). These candidate have been previously identified by Roig and Gil-Hutton (2006, Icarus 183, 411) using the Sloan Digital Sky Survey colors. The spectroscopic observations have been obtained at the Calar Alto Observatory, Spain, during observational runs in November and December 2006. The spectra of these two asteroids show the steep slope shortwards of 0.70 microns and the deep absorption feature longwards of 0.75 microns that are characteristic of V-type asteroids. However, the presence of a shallow but conspicuous absorption band around 0.65 microns opens some questions about the actual mineralogy of these two asteroids. Such band has never been observed before in basaltic asteroids with the intensity we detected it. We discuss the possibility for this shallow absorption feature to be caused by the presence of chromium on the asteroid surface. Our results indicate that, together with (1459) Magnya, asteroids (7472) Kumakiri and (10537) 1991 RY16 may be the only traces of basaltic material found up to now in the outer Main Belt.
231|Interpolating and sampling sequences in finite Riemann surfaces|Joaquim Ortega-Cerda|We provide a description of the interpolating and sampling sequences on a space of holomorphic functions with a uniform growth restriction defined on finite Riemann surfaces.
232|New algebraic aspects of perturbative and non-perturbative Quantum Field   Theory|Christoph Bergbauer, Dirk Kreimer|In this expository article we review recent advances in our understanding of the combinatorial and algebraic structure of perturbation theory in terms of Feynman graphs, and Dyson-Schwinger equations. Starting from Lie and Hopf algebras of Feynman graphs, perturbative renormalization is rephrased algebraically. The Hochschild cohomology of these Hopf algebras leads the way to Slavnov-Taylor identities and Dyson-Schwinger equations. We discuss recent progress in solving simple Dyson-Schwinger equations in the high energy sector using the algebraic machinery. Finally there is a short account on a relation to algebraic geometry and number theory: understanding Feynman integrals as periods of mixed (Tate) motives.
233|Many-body interband tunneling as a witness for complex dynamics in the   Bose-Hubbard model|Andrea Tomadin, Riccardo Mannella, and Sandro Wimberger|A perturbative model is studied for the tunneling of many-particle states from the ground band to the first excited energy band, mimicking Landau-Zener decay for ultracold, spinless atoms in quasi-one dimensional optical lattices subjected to a tunable tilting force. The distributions of the computed tunneling rates provide an independent and experimentally accessible signature of the regular-chaotic transition in the strongly correlated many-body dynamics of the ground band.
234|The Determination of the Helicity of $W'$ Boson Couplings at the LHC|Thomas G. Rizzo|Apart from its mass and width, the most important property of a new charged gauge boson, $W'$, is the helicity of its couplings to the SM fermions. Such particles are expected to exist in many extensions of the Standard Model. In this paper we explore the capability of the LHC to determine the $W'$ coupling helicity at low integrated luminosities in the $\ell +E_T^{miss}$ discovery channel. We find that measurements of the transverse mass distribution, reconstructed from this final state in the $W-W'$ interference region, provides the best determination of this quantity. To make such measurements requires integrated luminosities of $\sim 10(60) fb^{-1}$ assuming $M_{W'}=1.5(2.5)$ TeV and provided that the $W'$ couplings have Standard Model magnitude. This helicity determination can be further strengthened by the use of various discovery channel leptonic asymmetries, also measured in the same interference regime, but with higher integrated luminosities.
235|Curvature flows in semi-Riemannian manifolds|Claus Gerhardt|We prove that the limit hypersurfaces of converging curvature flows are stable, if the initial velocity has a weak sign, and give a survey of the existence and regularity results.
236|Hydrodynamic and Spectral Simulations of HMXB Winds|Christopher W. Mauche, Duane A. Liedahl, Shizuka Akiyama (Lawrence   Livermore Nat'l Lab.), Tomasz Plewa (University of Chicago)|We describe preliminary results of a global model of the radiatively-driven photoionized wind and accretion flow of the high-mass X-ray binary Vela X-1. The full model combines FLASH hydrodynamic calculations, XSTAR photoionization calculations, HULLAC atomic data, and Monte Carlo radiation transport. We present maps of the density, temperature, velocity, and ionization parameter from a FLASH two-dimensional time-dependent simulation of Vela X-1, as well as maps of the emissivity distributions of the X-ray emission lines.
237|Radio Astrometric Detection and Characterization of Extra-Solar Planets:   A White Paper Submitted to the NSF ExoPlanet Task Force|Geoffrey C. Bower (Berkeley), Alberto Bolatto (Berkeley), Eric Ford   (CfA, Florida), Paul Kalas (Berkeley), Jim Ulvestad (NRAO)|The extraordinary astrometric accuracy of radio interferometry creates an important and unique opportunity for the discovery and characterization of exo-planets. Currently, the Very Long Baseline Array can routinely achieve better than 100 microarcsecond accuracy, and can approach 10 microarcsecond with careful calibration. We describe here RIPL, the Radio Interferometric PLanet search, a new program with the VLBA and the Green Bank 100 m telescope that will survey 29 low-mass, active stars over 3 years with sub-Jovian planet mass sensitivity at 1 AU. An upgrade of the VLBA bandwidth will increase astrometric accuracy by an order of magnitude. Ultimately, the colossal collecting area of the Square Kilometer Array could push astrometric accuracy to 1 microarcsecond, making detection and characterizaiton of Earth mass planets possible.   RIPL and other future radio astrometric planet searches occupy a unique volume in planet discovery and characterization parameter space. The parameter space of astrometric searches gives greater sensitivity to planets at large radii than radial velocity searches. For the VLBA and the expanded VLBA, the targets of radio astrometric surveys are by necessity nearby, low-mass, active stars, which cannot be studied efficiently through the radial velocity method, coronagraphy, or optical interferometry. For the SKA, detection sensitivity will extend to solar-type stars. Planets discovered through radio astrometric methods will be suitable for characterization through extreme adaptive optics.   The complementarity of radio astrometric techniques with other methods demonstrates that radio astrometry can play an important role in the roadmap for exoplanet discovery and characterization.
238|Interface dynamics of microscopic cavities in water|Joachim Dzubiella|An analytical description of the interface motion of a collapsing nanometer-sized spherical cavity in water is presented by a modification of the Rayleigh-Plesset equation in conjunction with explicit solvent molecular dynamics simulations. Quantitative agreement is found between the two approaches for the time-dependent cavity radius $R(t)$ at different solvent conditions while in the continuum picture the solvent viscosity has to be corrected for curvature effects. The typical magnitude of the interface or collapse velocity is found to be given by the ratio of surface tension and fluid viscosity, $v\simeq\gamma/\eta$, while the curvature correction accelerates collapse dynamics on length scales below the equilibrium crossover scales ($\sim$1nm). The study offers a starting point for an efficient implicit modeling of water dynamics in aqueous nanoassembly and protein systems in nonequilibrium.
239|Viscosity, Black Holes, and Quantum Field Theory|D. T. Son, A. O. Starinets|We review recent progress in applying the AdS/CFT correspondence to finite-temperature field theory. In particular, we show how the hydrodynamic behavior of field theory is reflected in the low-momentum limit of correlation functions computed through a real-time AdS/CFT prescription, which we formulate. We also show how the hydrodynamic modes in field theory correspond to the low-lying quasinormal modes of the AdS black p-brane metric. We provide a proof of the universality of the viscosity/entropy ratio within a class of theories with gravity duals and formulate a viscosity bound conjecture. Possible implications for real systems are mentioned.
240|Superconducting states of the quasi-2D Holstein model: Effects of vertex   and non-local corrections|J.P.Hague|I investigate superconducting states in a quasi-2D Holstein model using the dynamical cluster approximation (DCA). The effects of spatial fluctuations (non-local corrections) are examined and approximations neglecting and incorporating lowest-order vertex corrections are computed. The approximation is expected to be valid for electron-phonon couplings of less than the bandwidth. The phase diagram and superconducting order parameter are calculated. Effects which can only be attributed to theories beyond Migdal--Eliashberg theory are present. In particular, the order parameter shows momentum dependence on the Fermi-surface with a modulated form and s-wave order is suppressed at half-filling. The results are discussed in relation to Hohenberg's theorem and the BCS approximation.
241|Masers and star formation|Vincent L. Fish (NRAO)|Recent observational and theoretical advances concerning astronomical masers in star forming regions are reviewed. Major masing species are considered individually and in combination. Key results are summarized with emphasis on present science and future prospects.
242|Renormalized quasiparticles in antiferromagnetic states of the Hubbard   model|J. Bauer and A.C. Hewson|We analyze the properties of the quasiparticle excitations of metallic antiferromagnetic states in a strongly correlated electron system. The study is based on dynamical mean field theory (DMFT) for the infinite dimensional Hubbard model with antiferromagnetic symmetry breaking. Self-consistent solutions of the DMFT equations are calculated using the numerical renormalization group (NRG). The low energy behavior in these results is then analyzed in terms of renormalized quasiparticles. The parameters for these quasiparticles are calculated directly from the NRG derived self-energy, and also from the low energy fixed point of the effective impurity. They are found to be in good agreement. We show that the main low energy features of the $\bf k$-resolved spectral density can be understood in terms of the quasiparticle picture. We also find that Luttinger's theorem is satisfied for the total electron number in the doped antiferromagnetic state.
243|Comparison of exact-exchange calculations for solids in   current-spin-density- and spin-density-functional theory|S. Sharma (1,2), S. Pittalis (2), S. Kurth (2), S. Shallcross (3), J.   K. Dewhurst (4) and E. K. U. Gross (2)|The relative merits of current-spin-density- and spin-density-functional theory are investigated for solids treated within the exact-exchange-only approximation. Spin-orbit splittings and orbital magnetic moments are determined at zero external magnetic field. We find that for magnetic (Fe, Co and Ni) and non-magnetic (Si and Ge) solids, the exact-exchange current-spin-density functional approach does not significantly improve the accuracy of the corresponding spin-density functional results.
244|One-loop MHV Rules and Pure Yang-Mills|Andreas Brandhuber, Bill Spence, Gabriele Travaglini, Konstantinos   Zoubos|It has been known for some time that the standard MHV diagram formulation of perturbative Yang-Mills theory is incomplete, as it misses rational terms in one-loop scattering amplitudes of pure Yang-Mills. We propose that certain Lorentz violating counterterms, when expressed in the field variables which give rise to standard MHV vertices, produce precisely these missing terms. These counterterms appear when Yang-Mills is treated with a regulator, introduced by Thorn and collaborators, which arises in worldsheet formulations of Yang-Mills theory in the lightcone gauge. As an illustration of our proposal, we show that a simple one-loop, two-point counterterm is the generating function for the infinite sequence of one-loop, all-plus helicity amplitudes in pure Yang-Mills, in complete agreement with known expressions.
245|Fermi-liquid effects in the transresistivity in quantum Hall double   layers near $\nu= 1/2 $|Natalya A. Zimbovskaya|Here, we present theoretical studies of the temperature and magnetic field dependences of the Coulomb drag transresistivity between two parallel layers of two dimensional electron gases in quantum Hall regime near half filling of the lowest Landau level. It is shown that Fermi-liquid interactions between the relevant quasiparticles could give a significant effect on the transresistivity, providing its independence of the interlayer spacing for spacings taking on values reported in the experiments. Obtained results agree with the experimental evidence.
246|Geometry of four-dimensional Killing spinors|S. L. Cacciatori, M. M. Caldarelli, D. Klemm, D. S. Mansi, D. Roest|The supersymmetric solutions of N=2, D=4 minimal ungauged and gauged supergravity are classified according to the fraction of preserved supersymmetry using spinorial geometry techniques. Subject to a reasonable assumption in the 1/2-supersymmetric time-like case of the gauged theory, we derive the complete form of all supersymmetric solutions. This includes a number of new 1/4- and 1/2-supersymmetric possibilities, like gravitational waves on bubbles of nothing in AdS_4.
247|A Rigorous Time-Domain Analysis of Full--Wave Electromagnetic Cloaking   (Invisibility)|Ricardo Weder|There is currently a great deal of interest in the theoretical and practical possibility of cloaking objects from the observation by electromagnetic waves. The basic idea of these invisibility devices \cite{glu1, glu2, le},\cite{pss1} is to use anisotropic {\it transformation media} whose permittivity and permeability $\var^{\lambda\nu}, \mu^{\lambda\nu}$, are obtained from the ones, $\var_0^{\lambda\nu}, \mu^{\lambda\nu}_0$, of isotropic media, by singular transformations of coordinates. In this paper we study electromagnetic cloaking in the time-domain using the formalism of time-dependent scattering theory. This formalism allows us to settle in an unambiguous way the mathematical problems posed by the singularities of the inverse of the permittivity and the permeability of the {\it transformation media} on the boundary of the cloaked objects. We write Maxwell's equations in Schr\"odinger form with the electromagnetic propagator playing the role of the Hamiltonian. We prove that the electromagnetic propagator outside of the cloaked objects is essentially self-adjoint. Moreover, the unique self-adjoint extension is unitarily equivalent to the electromagnetic propagator in the medium $\var_0^{\lambda\nu}, \mu^{\lambda\nu}_0$. Using this fact, and since the coordinate transformation is the identity outside of a ball, we prove that the scattering operator is the identity. Our results give a rigorous proof that the construction of \cite{glu1, glu2, le}, \cite{pss1} perfectly cloaks passive and active devices from observation by electromagnetic waves. Furthermore, we prove cloaking for general anisotropic materials. In particular, our results prove that it is possible to cloak objects inside general crystals.
248|Non-perturbative conserving approximations and Luttinger's sum rule|Jutta Ortloff, Matthias Balzer, Michael Potthoff|Weak-coupling conserving approximations can be constructed by truncations of the Luttinger-Ward functional and are well known as thermodynamically consistent approaches which respect macroscopic conservation laws as well as certain sum rules at zero temperature. These properties can also be shown for variational approximations that are generated within the framework of the self-energy-functional theory without a truncation of the diagram series. Luttinger's sum rule represents an exception. We analyze the conditions under which the sum rule holds within a non-perturbative conserving approximation. Numerical examples are given for a simple but non-trivial dynamical two-site approximation. The validity of the sum rule for finite Hubbard clusters and the consequences for cluster extensions of the dynamical mean-field theory are discussed.
249|2D-MIT as self-doping of a Wigner-Mott insulator|S. Pankov and V. Dobrosavljevic|We consider an interaction-driven scenario for the two-dimensional metal-insulator transition in zero magnetic field (2D-MIT), based on melting the Wigner crystal through vacancy-interstitial pair formation. We show that the transition from the Wigner-Mott insulator to a heavy Fermi liquid emerges as an instability to self-doping, resembling conceptually the solid to normal liquid transition in He3. The resulting physical picture naturally explains many puzzling features of the 2D-MIT.
250|Entanglement of Subspaces and Error Correcting Codes|Gilad Gour, Nolan R. Wallach|We introduce the notion of entanglement of subspaces as a measure that quantify the entanglement of bipartite states in a randomly selected subspace. We discuss its properties and in particular we show that for maximally entangled subspaces it is additive. Furthermore, we show that maximally entangled subspaces can play an important role in the study of quantum error correction codes. We discuss both degenerate and non-degenerate codes and show that the subspace spanned by the logical codewords of a non-degenerate code is a 2k-totally (maximally) entangled subspace. As for non-degenerate codes, we provide a mathematical definition in terms of subspaces and, as an example, we analyze Shor's nine qubits code in terms of 22 mutually orthogonal subspaces.
251|Does the present data on B_s - bar B_s mixing rule out a large   enhancement in the branching ratio of B_s --> mu+ mu- ?|Ashutosh Kumar Alok and S. Uma Sankar|In this letter, we consider the constraints imposed by the recent measurement of B_s - bar B_s mixing on the new physics contribution to the rare decay B_s --> mu+ mu-. New physics in the form vector and axial-vector couplings is already severely constrained by the data on B --> (K,K*) mu+ mu-. Here, we show that B_s - bar B_s mixing data, together with the data on K0 - bar K0 mixing and K_L --> mu+ mu- decay rate, strongly constrain the scalar-pseudoscalar contribution to B_s --> mu+ mu-. We conclude that new physics can at best lead to a factor of 2 increase in the branching ratio of B_s --> mu+ mu- compared to its Standard Model expectation.
252|The Spitzer c2d Survey of Large, Nearby, Interstellar Clouds VIII.   Serpens Observed with MIPS|Paul M. Harvey, Luisa M. Rebull, Tim Brooke, William J. Spiesman,   Nicholas Chapman, Tracy L. Huard, Neal J. Evans II, Lucas Cieza, Shih-Ping   Lai, Lori E. Allen, Lee G. Mundy, Deborah L. Padgett, Anneila I. Sargent,   Karl R. Stapelfeldt, Philip C. Myers, Ewine F. van Dishoeck, Geoffrey A.   Blake, David W. Koerner|We present maps of 1.5 square degrees of the Serpens dark cloud at 24, 70, and 160\micron observed with the Spitzer Space Telescope MIPS Camera. More than 2400 compact sources have been extracted at 24um, nearly 100 at 70um, and 4 at 160um. We estimate completeness limits for our 24um survey from Monte Carlo tests with artificial sources inserted into the Spitzer maps. We compare source counts, colors, and magnitudes in the Serpens cloud to two reference data sets, a 0.50 deg^2 set on a low-extinction region near the dark cloud, and a 5.3 deg^2 subset of the SWIRE ELAIS N1 data that was processed through our pipeline. These results show that there is an easily identifiable population of young stellar object candidates in the Serpens Cloud that is not present in either of the reference data sets. We also show a comparison of visual extinction and cool dust emission illustrating a close correlation between the two, and find that the most embedded YSO candidates are located in the areas of highest visual extinction.
253|Unravelling the sbottom spin at the CERN LHC|Alexandre Alves and Oscar Eboli|Establishing that a signal of new physics is undoubtly supersymmetric requires not only the discovery of the supersymmetric partners but also probing their spins and couplings. We show that the sbottom spin can be probed at the CERN Large Hadron Collider using only angular correlations in sbottom pair production with subsequent decay of sbottoms into bottom quark plus the lightest neutralino, which allow us to distinguish a universal extra dimensional interpretation with a fermionic heavy bottom quark from supersymmetry with a bosonic bottom squark. We demonstrate that this channel provides a clear indication of the sbottom spin provided the sbottom production rate and branching ratio into bottom quark plus the lightest neutralino are sufficiently large to have a clear signal above Standard Model backgrounds.
254|Modeling the three-point correlation function|Felipe Marin (Chicago, KICP), Risa Wechsler (KIPAC, Stanford), Joshua   Frieman (Chicago, KICP and Fermilab), Robert Nichol (ICG, Portsmouth)|We present new predictions for the galaxy three-point correlation function (3PCF) using high-resolution dissipationless cosmological simulations of a flat LCDM Universe which resolve galaxy-size halos and subhalos. We create realistic mock galaxy catalogs by assigning luminosities and colors to dark matter halos and subhalos, and we measure the reduced 3PCF as a function of luminosity and color in both real and redshift space. As galaxy luminosity and color are varied, we find small differences in the amplitude and shape dependence of the reduced 3PCF, at a level qualitatively consistent with recent measurements from the SDSS and 2dFGRS. We confirm that discrepancies between previous 3PCF measurements can be explained in part by differences in binning choices. We explore the degree to which a simple local bias model can fit the simulated 3PCF. The agreement between the model predictions and galaxy 3PCF measurements lends further credence to the straightforward association of galaxies with CDM halos and subhalos.
255|Multi-spectral Observations of Lunar Occultations: I. Resolving The Dust   Shell Around AFGL 5440|Paul M. Harvey and Andrew Oldag|We present observations and modeling of a lunar occultation of the dust-enshrouded carbon star AFGL 5440. The observations were made over a continuous range of wavelengths from 1 - 4um with a high-speed spectrophotometer designed expressly for this purpose. We find that the occultation fringes cannot be fit by any single-size model. We use the DUSTY radiative transfer code to model a circumstellar shell and fit both the observed occultation light curves and the spectral energy distribution described in the literature. We find a strong constraint on the inner radius of the dust shell, Tmax = 950 K +/- 50K, and optical depth at 5um of 0.5 +/- 0.1. The observations are best fit by models with a density gradient of r^-2 or the gradient derived by Ivezic & Elitzur for a radiatively driven hydrodynamic outflow. Our models cannot fit the observed IRAS 60um flux without assuming a substantial abundance of graphite or by assuming a substantially higher mass-loss rate in the past.
256|Orbifold cohomology of abelian symplectic reductions and the case of   weighted projective spaces|Tara S. Holm|These notes accompany a lecture about the topology of symplectic (and other) quotients. The aim is two-fold: first to advertise the ease of computation in the symplectic category; and second to give an account of some new computations for weighted projective spaces. We start with a brief exposition of how orbifolds arise in the symplectic category, and discuss the techniques used to understand their topology. We then show how these results can be used to compute the Chen-Ruan orbifold cohomology ring of abelian symplectic reductions. We conclude by comparing the several rings associated to a weighted projective space. We make these computations directly, avoiding any mention of a stacky fan or of a labeled moment polytope.
257|Correlation functions in the Non Perturbative Renormalization Group and   field expansion|Diego Guerra, Ramon Mendez-Galain and Nicolas Wschebor|The usual procedure of including a finite number of vertices in Non Perturbative Renormalization Group equations in order to obtain $n$-point correlation functions at finite momenta is analyzed. This is done by exploiting a general method recently introduced which includes simultaneously all vertices although approximating their momentum dependence. The study is performed using the self-energy of the tridimensional scalar model at criticality. At least in this example, low order truncations miss quantities as the critical exponent $\eta$ by as much as 60%. However, if one goes to high order truncations the procedure seems to converge rapidly.
258|Formation and Collisional Evolution of Kuiper Belt Objects|Scott J. Kenyon, Benjamin C. Bromley, David P. O'Brien, Donald R.   Davis|This chapter summarizes analytic theory and numerical calculations for the formation and collisional evolution of KBOs at 20--150 AU. We describe the main predictions of a baseline self-stirring model and show how dynamical perturbations from a stellar flyby or stirring by a giant planet modify the evolution. Although robust comparisons between observations and theory require better KBO statistics and more comprehensive calculations, the data are broadly consistent with KBO formation in a massive disk followed by substantial collisional grinding and dynamical ejection. However, there are important problems reconciling the results of coagulation and dynamical calculations. Contrasting our current understanding of the evolution of KBOs and asteroids suggests that additional observational constraints, such as the identification of more dynamical families of KBOs (like the 2003 EL61 family), would provide additional information on the relative roles of collisional grinding and dynamical ejection in the Kuiper Belt. The uncertainties also motivate calculations that combine collisional and dynamical evolution, a `unified' calculation that should give us a better picture of KBO formation and evolution.
259|On Existence of Boundary Values of Polyharmonic Functions|M. L. Gorbachuk, S. M. Torba|In trigonometric series terms all polyharmonic functions inside the unit disk are described. For such functions it is proved the existence of their boundary values on the unit circle in the space of hyperfunctions. The necessary and sufficient conditions are presented for the boundary value to belong to certain subspaces of the space of hyperfunctions.
260|Constraints on the Self-Interaction Cross-Section of Dark Matter from   Numerical Simulations of the Merging Galaxy Cluster 1E 0657-5|Scott W. Randall, Maxim Markevitch, Douglas Clowe, Anthony H.   Gonzalez, and Marusa Bradac|(Abridged) We compare recent results from X-ray, strong lensing, weak lensing, and optical observations with numerical simulations of the merging galaxy cluster 1E0657-56. X-ray observations reveal a bullet-like subcluster with a prominent bow shock, while lensing results show that the positions of the total mass peaks are consistent with the centroids of the collisionless galaxies (and inconsistent with the X-ray brightness peaks). Previous studies, based on older observational datasets, have placed upper limits on the self-interaction cross-section of dark matter per unit mass, sigma/m, using simplified analytic techniques. In this work, we take advantage of new, higher-quality observational datasets by running N-body simulations of 1E0657-56 that include the effects of self-interacting dark matter, and comparing the results with observations. Furthermore, the recent data allow for a new independent method of constraining sigma/m, based on the non-observation of an offset between the bullet subcluster mass peak and galaxy centroid. This new method places an upper limit (68% confidence) of sigma/m < 1.25 cm^2/g. If we make the assumption that the subcluster and the main cluster had equal mass-to-light ratios prior to the merger, we derive our most stringent constraint of sigma/m < 0.7 cm^2/g, which comes from the consistency of the subcluster's observed mass-to-light ratio with the main cluster's, and with the universal cluster value, ruling out the possibility of a large fraction of dark matter particles being scattered away due to collisions. Our limit is a slight improvement over the previous result from analytic estimates, and rules out most of the 0.5 - 5cm^2/g range invoked to explain inconsistencies between the standard collisionless cold dark matter model and observations.
261|Stringy Instantons at Orbifold Singularities|Riccardo Argurio, Matteo Bertolini, Gabriele Ferretti, Alberto Lerda   and Christoffer Petersson|We study the effects produced by D-brane instantons on the holomorphic quantities of a D-brane gauge theory at an orbifold singularity. These effects are not limited to reproducing the well known contributions of the gauge theory instantons but also generate extra terms in the superpotential or the prepotential. On these brane instantons there are some neutral fermionic zero-modes in addition to the ones expected from broken supertranslations. They are crucial in correctly reproducing effects which are dual to gauge theory instantons, but they may make some other interesting contributions vanish. We analyze how orientifold projections can remove these zero-modes and thus allow for new superpotential terms. These terms contribute to the dynamics of the effective gauge theory, for instance in the stabilization of runaway directions.
262|Turbulent Diffusion of Lines and Circulations|Gregory L. Eyink|We study material lines and passive vectors in a model of turbulent flow at infinite-Reynolds number, the Kraichnan-Kazantsev ensemble of velocities that are white-noise in time and rough (Hoelder continuous) in space. It is argued that the phenomenon of ``spontaneous stochasticity'' generalizes to material lines and that conservation of circulations generalizes to a ``martingale property'' of the stochastic process of lines.
263|Gluon Radiation of an Expanding Color Skyrmion in the Quark-Gluon Plasma|Jian Dai|The density of states and energy spectrum of the gluon radiation are calculated for the color current of an expanding hydrodynamic skyrmion in the quark gluon plasma with a semiclassical method. Results are compared with those in literatures.
264|REM near-IR and optical multiband observations of PKS2155-304 in 2005|A. Dolcini, F. Farfanelli, S. Ciprini, A. Treves, S. Covino, G. Tosti,   E. Pian, B. Sbarufatti, E. Molinari, G. Chincarini, F.M. Zerbi, G. Malaspina,   P. Conconi, L. Nicastro, E. Palazzi, V. Testa, F. Vitali, L.A. Antonelli, J.   Danziger, G. Tagliaferri, E. Meurs, S. Vergani, A. Fernandez-Soto, E.   Distefano, G. Cutispoto, F. D'Alessio|Spectral variability is the main tool for constraining emission models of BL   Lac objects. By means of systematic observations of the BL Lac prototype PKS 2155-304 in the infrared-optical band, we explore variability on the scales of months, days and hours. We made our observations with the robotic 60 cm telescope REM located at La Silla, Chile. VRIJHK filters were used. PKS 2155-304 was observed from May to December 2005. The wavelength interval explored, the total number of photometric points and the short integration time render our photometry substantially superior to previous ones for this source. On the basis of the intensity and colour we distinguish three different states of the source, each of duration of months, which include all those described in the literature. In particular, we report the highest state ever detected in the H band. The source varied by a factor of 4 in this band, much more than in the V band (a factor ~2). The source softened with increasing intensity, contrary to the general pattern observed in the UV-X-ray bands. On five nights of November we had nearly continuous monitoring for 2-3 hours. A variability episode with a time scale of ~24 h is well documented, a much more rapid flare with t=1-2 h, is also apparent, but is supported by relatively few points.
265|Supernova Polarization and the Type IIn Classification|Jennifer L. Hoffman|While the members of the Type IIn category of supernovae are united by the presence of strong multicomponent Balmer emission lines in their spectra, they are quite heterogeneous with respect to other properties such as Balmer line profiles, light curves, strength of radio emission, and intrinsic brightness. We are now beginning to see variety among SNe IIn in their polarimetric characteristics as well, some but not all of which may be due to inclination angle effects. The increasing number of known "hybrid" SNe with IIn-like emission lines suggests that circumstellar material may be more common around all types of SNe than previously thought. Investigation of the correlations between spectropolarimetric signatures and other IIn attributes will help us address the question of classification of "interacting SNe" and the possibility of distinguishing different groups within the diverse IIn subclass.
266|Near-Infrared Spectra of the Black Hole X-Ray Binary, A0620-00|C.S. Froning, E.L. Robinson, and M.A. Bitner|We present broadband NIR spectra of A0620-00 obtained with SpeX on the IRTF. The spectrum is characterized by a blue continuum on which are superimposed broad emission lines of HI and HeII and a host of narrower absorption lines of neutral metals and molecules. Spectral type standard star spectra scaled to the dereddened spectrum of A0620-00 in K exceed the A0620-00 spectrum in J and H for all stars of spectral type K7V or earlier, demonstrating that the donor star, unless later than K7V, cannot be the sole NIR flux source in A0620-00. In addition, the atomic absorption lines in the K3V spectrum are too weak with respect to those of A0620-00 even at 100% donor star contribution, restricting the spectral type of the donor star in A0620-00 to later than K3V. Comparison of the A0620-00 spectrum to scaled K star spectra indicates that the CO absorption features are significantly weaker in A0620-00 than in field dwarf stars. Fits of scaled model spectra of a Roche lobe-filling donor star to the spectrum of A0620-00 show that the best match to the CO absorption lines is obtained when the C abundance is reduced to [C/H] = -1.5. The donor star contribution in the H waveband is determined to be 82+-2%. Combined with previous published results from Froning & Robinson (2001) and Marsh et al. (1994), this gives a precise mass for the black hole in A0620-00 of M_BH = 9.7+-0.6 M_solar.
267|Automated Generation of Layout and Control for Quantum Circuits|Mark Whitney, Nemanja Isailovic, Yatish Patel, John Kubiatowicz|We present a computer-aided design flow for quantum circuits, complete with automatic layout and control logic extraction. To motivate automated layout for quantum circuits, we investigate grid-based layouts and show a performance variance of four times as we vary grid structure and initial qubit placement. We then propose two polynomial-time design heuristics: a greedy algorithm suitable for small, congestion-free quantum circuits and a dataflow-based analysis approach to placement and routing with implicit initial placement of qubits. Finally, we show that our dataflow-based heuristic generates better layouts than the state-of-the-art automated grid-based layout and scheduling mechanism in terms of latency and potential pipelinability, but at the cost of some area.
268|Modeling the Spectral Energy Distribution and Variability of 3C 66A   during the WEBT campaign of 2003 -- 2004|M. Joshi and M. Boettcher|The BL Lac object 3C 66A was observed in an extensive multiwavelength monitoring campaign from July 2003 till April 2004. The spectral energy distribution (SED) was measured over the entire electromagnetic spectrum, with flux measurements from radio to X-ray frequencies and upper limits in the very high energy (VHE) gamma-ray regime. Here, we use a time-dependent leptonic jet model to reproduce the SED and optical spectral variability observed during our multiwavelength campaign. Our model simulations could successfully reproduce the observed SED and optical light curves and predict an intrinsic cutoff value for the VHE gamma-ray emission at ~ 4 GeV. The effect of the optical depth due to the intergalactic infrared background radiation (IIBR) on the peak of the high-energy component of 3C 66A was found to be negligible. Also, the presence of a broad line region (BLR) in the case of 3C 66A may play an important role in the emission of gamma-ray photons when the emission region is very close to the central engine, but further out, the production mechanism of hard X-ray and gamma-ray photons becomes rapidly dominated by synchrotron self-Compton emission. We further discuss the possibility of an observable X-ray spectral variability pattern. The simulated results do not predict observable hysteresis patterns in the optical or soft X-ray regimes for major flares on multi-day time scales.
269|The HARPS search for southern extra-solar planets. X. A m sin i = 11   Mearth planet around the nearby spotted M dwarf GJ 674|X. Bonfils, M. Mayor, X. Delfosse, T. Forveille, M. Gillon, C.   Perrier, S. Udry, F. Bouchy, C. Lovis, F. Pepe, D. Queloz, N. C. Santos and   J.-L. Bertaux|Context: How planet properties depend on stellar mass is a key diagnostic of planetary formation mechanisms. Aims: This motivates planet searches around stars which are significantly more massive or less massive than the Sun, and in particular our radial velocity search for planets around very-low mass stars. Methods: As part of that program, we obtained measurements of GJ 674, an M2.5 dwarf at d=4.5 pc, which have a dispersion much in excess of their internal errors. An intensive observing campaign demonstrates that the excess dispersion is due to two superimposed coherent signals, with periods of 4.69 and 35 days. Results: These data are well described by a 2-planet Keplerian model where each planet has a ~11 Mearth minimum mass. A careful analysis of the (low level) magnetic activity of GJ 674 however demonstrates that the 35-day period coincides with the stellar rotation period. This signal therefore originates in a spot inhomogeneity modulated by stellar rotation. The 4.69-day signal on the other hand is caused by a bona-fide planet, GJ 674b. Conclusion: Its detection adds to the growing number of Neptune-mass planets around M-dwarfs, and reinforces the emerging conclusion that this mass domain is much more populated than the jovian mass range. We discuss the metallicity distributions of M dwarf with and without planets and find a low 11% probability that they are drawn from the same parent distribution. Moreover, we find tentative evidence that the host star metallicity correlates with the total mass of their planetary system.
270|An individual based model with global competition interaction:   fluctuations effects in pattern formation|E. Brigatti, V. Schwammle and Minos A. Neto|We present some numerical results obtained from a simple individual based model that describes clustering of organisms caused by competition. Our aim is to show how, even when a deterministic description developed for continuum models predicts no pattern formation, an individual based model displays well defined patterns, as a consequence of fluctuations effects caused by the discrete nature of the interacting agents.
271|A Comparison between Anomalous 6-cm H$_2$CO Absorption and CO(1-0)   Emission in the L1204/S140|Monica Ivette Rodriguez, Tommy Wiklind, Ronald J. Allen, Vladimir   Escalante, and Laurent Loinard|We report observations of the dust cloud L1204 with the Onsala 25-m telescope in the 6 cm (1$_{11}-1_{10}$) transition of \htco. The observed region includes the   S140 H${\alpha}$ arc. This spectral line is seen here in absorption against the cosmic microwave background, indicating the presence of widespread warm molecular gas at intermediate densities. Overall, the distributions of H$_2$CO and CO (taken from the literature) are fairly similar, though significant differences exist at small scales. Most notably, while the CO peak is nearly coincident with the S140 H${\alpha}$ arc, the maximum H$_2$CO absorption is clearly separated from it by a full 10$'$ beam ($\sim$ 3 pc). We argue that these differences result from differing abundances and excitation requirements. The CO(1-0) line is more optically thick and more biased towards warm gas than the H$_2$CO 6 cm line. On the other hand, formaldehyde is more easily photodissociated and is, therefore, a poorer tracer of the molecular gas located immediately behind Photon Dominated Regions.
272|Dimers on surface graphs and spin structures. II|David Cimasoni, Nicolai Reshetikhin|In a previous paper, we showed how certain orientations of the edges of a graph G embedded in a closed oriented surface S can be understood as discrete spin structures on S. We then used this correspondence to give a geometric proof of the Pfaffian formula for the partition function of the dimer model on G. In the present article, we generalize these results to the case of compact oriented surfaces with boundary. We also show how the operations of cutting and gluing act on discrete spin structures and how they change the partition function. These operations allow to reformulate the dimer model as a quantum field theory on surface graphs.
273|New version announcement for TaylUR, an arbitrary-order diagonal   automatic differentiation package for Fortran 95|Georg M. von Hippel|We present a new version of TaylUR, a Fortran 95 module to automatically compute the numerical values of a complex-valued function's derivatives with respect to several variables up to an arbitrary order in each variable, but excluding mixed derivatives. The new version fixes a potentially serious bug in the code for exponential-related functions that could corrupt the imaginary parts of derivatives, as well as being compatible with a wider range of compilers.
274|Mapping radii of metric spaces|George M. Bergman (U.C.Berkeley)|It is known that every closed curve of length \leq 4 in R^n (n>0) can be surrounded by a sphere of radius 1, and that this is the best bound. Letting S denote the circle of circumference 4, with the arc-length metric, we here express this fact by saying that the "mapping radius" of S in R^n is 1.   Tools are developed for estimating the mapping radius of a metric space X in a metric space Y. In particular, it is shown that for X a bounded metric space, the supremum of the mapping radii of X in all convex subsets of normed metric spaces is equal to the infimum of the sup norms of all convex linear combinations of the functions d(x,-): X --> R (x\in X).   Several explicit mapping radii are calculated, and open questions noted.
275|A New Model For The Loop-I (The North Polar Spur) Region|M. Wolleben|The North Polar Spur (NPS) is the brightest filament of Loop I, a large circular feature in the radio continuum sky. In this paper, a model consisting of two synchrotron emitting shells is presented that reproduces large-scale structures revealed by recent polarization surveys. The polarized emission of the NPS is reproduced by one of these shells. The other shell, which passes close to the Sun, gives rise to polarized emission towards the Galactic poles. It is proposed that X-ray emission seen towards the NPS is produced by interaction of the two shells. Two OB-associations coincide with the centers of the shells. A formation scenario of the Loop I region is suggested.
276|Leray numbers of projections and a topological Helly type theorem|Gil Kalai and Roy Meshulam|Let X be a simplicial complex on the vertex set V. The rational Leray number L(X) of X is the minimal d such that the rational reduced homology of any induced subcomplex of X vanishes in dimensions d and above. Let \pi be a simplicial map from X to a simplex Y, such that the cardinality of the preimage of any point in Y is at most r. It is shown that L(\pi(X)) \leq r L(X)+r-1. One consequence is a topological extension of a Helly type result of Amenta.
277|q-Deformed spin foam models of quantum gravity|Igor Khavkine, J. Daniel Christensen|We numerically study Barrett-Crane models of Riemannian quantum gravity. We have extended the existing numerical techniques to handle q-deformed models and arbitrary space-time triangulations. We present and interpret expectation values of a few selected observables for each model, including a spin-spin correlation function which gives insight into the behaviour of the models. We find the surprising result that, as the deformation parameter q goes to 1 through roots of unity, the limit is discontinuous.
278|HI velocity dispersion in NGC 1058|A. O. Petric and M. P. Rupen|We present excellent resolution and high sensitivity Very Large Array (VLA) observations of the 21cm HI line emission from the face-on galaxy NGC 1058, providing the first reliable study of the HI profile shapes throughout the entire disk of an external galaxy. Our observations show an intriguing picture of the interstellar medium; throughout this galaxy velocity-- dispersions range between 4 to 15 km/sec but are not correlated with star formation, stars or the gaseous spiral arms. The velocity dispersions decrease with radius, but this global trend has a large scatter as there are several isolated, resolved regions of high dispersion. The decline of star light with radius is much steeper than that of the velocity dispersions or that of the energy in the gas motions.
279|Common Envelope Evolution Redux|Ronald F. Webbink (University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign)|Common envelopes form in dynamical time scale mass exchange, when the envelope of a donor star engulfs a much denser companion, and the core of the donor plus the dense companion star spiral inward through this dissipative envelope. As conceived by Paczynski and Ostriker, this process must be responsible for the creation of short-period binaries with degenerate components, and, indeed, it has proven capable of accounting for short-period binaries containing one white dwarf component. However, attempts to reconstruct the evolutionary histories of close double white dwarfs have proven more problematic, and point to the need for enhanced systemic mass loss, either during the close of the first, slow episode of mass transfer that produced the first white dwarf, or during the detached phase preceding the final, common envelope episode. The survival of long-period interacting binaries with massive white dwarfs, such as the recurrent novae T CrB and RS Oph, also presents interpretative difficulties for simple energetic treatments of common envelope evolution. Their existence implies that major terms are missing from usual formulations of the energy budget for common envelope evolution. The most plausible missing energy term is the energy released by recombination in the common envelope, and, indeed, a simple reformulation the energy budget explicitly including recombination resolves this issue.

281|On Punctured Pragmatic Space-Time Codes in Block Fading Channel|Samuele Bandi, Luca Stabellini, Andrea Conti and Velio Tralli|This paper considers the use of punctured convolutional codes to obtain pragmatic space-time trellis codes over block-fading channel. We show that good performance can be achieved even when puncturation is adopted and that we can still employ the same Viterbi decoder of the convolutional mother code by using approximated metrics without increasing the complexity of the decoding operations.
282|On the Markov trace for Temperley--Lieb algebras of type $E_n$|R.M. Green|We show that there is a unique Markov trace on the tower of Temperley--Lieb type quotients of Hecke algebras of Coxeter type $E_n$ (for all $n \geq 6$). We explain in detail how this trace may be computed easily using tom Dieck's calculus of diagrams. As applications, we show how to use the trace to show that the diagram representation is faithful, and to compute leading coefficients of certain Kazhdan--Lusztig polynomials.
283|Second Order Perturbative Calculation of Quasinormal Modes of   Schwarzschild Black Holes|Hsien-chung Kao|We analytically calculate to second order the correction to the asymptotic form of quasinormal frequencies of four dimensional Schwarzschild black holes based on the monodromy analysis proposed by Motl and Neitzke. Our results are in good agreement with those obtained from numerical calculation.
284|Epitaxial graphene|Walt A. de Heer, Claire Berger, Xiaosong Wu, Phillip N. First, Edward   H. Conrad, Xuebin Li, Tianbo Li, Michael Sprinkle, Joanna Hass, Marcin L.   Sadowski, Marek Potemski, Gerard Martinez|Graphene multilayers are grown epitaxially on single crystal silicon carbide. This system is composed of several graphene layers of which the first layer is electron doped due to the built-in electric field and the other layers are essentially undoped. Unlike graphite the charge carriers show Dirac particle properties (i.e. an anomalous Berry's phase, weak anti-localization and square root field dependence of the Landau level energies). Epitaxial graphene shows quasi-ballistic transport and long coherence lengths; properties which may persists above cryogenic temperatures. Paradoxically, in contrast to exfoliated graphene, the quantum Hall effect is not observed in high mobility epitaxial graphene. It appears that the effect is suppressed due to absence of localized states in the bulk of the material.Epitaxial graphene can be patterned using standard lithography methods and characterized using a wide array of techniques. These favorable features indicate that interconnected room temperature ballistic devices may be feasible for low dissipation high-speed nanoelectronics.

286|Search for Very High Energy Emission from Gamma-Ray Bursts using Milagro|Pablo M. Saz Parkinson (Milagro Collaboration)|Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) have been detected at GeV energies by EGRET and models predict emission at > 100 GeV. Milagro is a wide field (2 sr) high duty cycle (> 90 %) ground based water Cherenkov detector that records extensive air showers in the energy range 100 GeV to 100 TeV. We have searched for very high energy emission from a sample of 106 gamma-ray bursts (GRB) detected since the beginning of 2000 by BATSE, BeppoSax, HETE-2, INTEGRAL, Swift or the IPN. No evidence for emission from any of the bursts has been found and we present upper limits from these bursts.
287|Specific heat and bimodality in canonical and grand canonical versions   of the thermodynamic model|G. Chaudhuri, S. Das Gupta|We address two issues in the thermodynamic model for nuclear disassembly. Surprisingly large differences in results for specific heat were seen in predictions from the canonical and grand canonical ensembles when the nuclear system passes from liquid-gas co-existence to the pure gas phase. We are able to pinpoint and understand the reasons for such and other discrepancies when they appear. There is a subtle but important difference in the physics addressed in the two models. In particular if we reformulate the parameters in the canonical model to better approximate the physics addressed in the grand canonical model, calculations for observables converge. Next we turn to the issue of bimodality in the probability distribution of the largest fragment in both canonical and grand canonical ensembles. We demonstrate that this distribution is very closely related to average multiplicities. The relationship of the bimodal distribution to phase transition is discussed.
288|Vortex proliferation in the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless regime on a   two-dimensional lattice of Bose-Einstein condensates|V. Schweikhard, S. Tung, and E. A. Cornell|We observe the proliferation of vortices in the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless regime on a two-dimensional array of Josephson-coupled Bose-Einstein condensates. As long as the Josephson (tunneling) energy J exceeds the thermal energy T, the array is vortex-free. With decreasing J/T, vortices appear in the system in ever greater numbers. We confirm thermal activation as the vortex formation mechanism and obtain information on the size of bound vortex pairs as J/T is varied.
289|The core binary fractions of star clusters from realistic simulations|Jarrod R. Hurley, Sverre J. Aarseth, Michael M. Shara|We investigate the evolution of binary fractions in star clusters using N-body models of up to 100000 stars. Primordial binary frequencies in these models range from 5% to 50%. Simulations are performed with the NBODY4 code and include a full mass spectrum of stars, stellar evolution, binary evolution and the tidal field of the Galaxy. We find that the overall binary fraction of a cluster almost always remains close to the primordial value, except at late times when a cluster is near dissolution. A critical exception occurs in the central regions where we observe a marked increase in binary fraction with time -- a simulation starting with 100000 stars and 5% binaries reached a core binary frequency as high as 40% at the end of the core-collapse phase (occurring at 16 Gyr with ~20000 stars remaining). Binaries are destroyed in the core by a variety of processes as a cluster evolves, but the combination of mass-segregation and creation of new binaries in exchange interactions produces the observed increase in relative number. We also find that binaries are cycled into and out of cluster cores in a manner that is analogous to convection in stars. For models of 100000 stars we show that the evolution of the core-radius up to the end of the initial phase of core-collapse is not affected by the exact value of the primordial binary frequency (for frequencies of 10% or less). We discuss the ramifications of our results for the likely primordial binary content of globular clusters.
290|Approaching the Heisenberg limit in an atom laser|M. Jeppesen, J. Dugu\'e, G. R. Dennis, M. T. Johnsson, C. Figl, N. P.   Robins and J. D. Close|We present experimental and theoretical results showing the improved beam quality and reduced divergence of an atom laser produced by an optical Raman transition, compared to one produced by an RF transition. We show that Raman outcoupling can eliminate the diverging lens effect that the condensate has on the outcoupled atoms. This substantially improves the beam quality of the atom laser, and the improvement may be greater than a factor of ten for experiments with tight trapping potentials. We show that Raman outcoupling can produce atom lasers whose quality is only limited by the wavefunction shape of the condensate that produces them, typically a factor of 1.3 above the Heisenberg limit.
291|A practical Seedless Infrared-Safe Cone jet algorithm|Gavin P. Salam and Gregory Soyez|Current cone jet algorithms, widely used at hadron colliders, take event particles as seeds in an iterative search for stable cones. A longstanding infrared (IR) unsafety issue in such algorithms is often assumed to be solvable by adding extra `midpoint' seeds, but actually is just postponed to one order higher in the coupling. A proper solution is to switch to an exact seedless cone algorithm, one that provably identifies all stable cones. The only existing approach takes N 2^N time to find jets among N particles, making it unusable at hadron level. This can be reduced to N^2 ln(N) time, leading to code (SISCone) whose speed is similar to that of public midpoint implementations. Monte Carlo tests provide a strong cross-check of an analytical proof of the IR safety of the new algorithm, and the absence of any 'R_{sep}' issue implies a good practical correspondence between parton and hadron levels. Relative to a midpoint cone, the use of an IR safe seedless algorithm leads to modest changes for inclusive jet spectra, mostly through reduced sensitivity to the underlying event, and significant changes for some multi-jet observables.
292|Isospin breaking in the yield of heavy meson pairs in e+e- annihilation   near threshold|S. Dubynskiy, A. Le Yaouanc, L. Oliver, J.-C. Raynal and M.B. Voloshin|We revisit the problem of interplay between the strong and the Coulomb interaction in the charged-to-neutral yield ratio for $B {\bar B}$ and $D {\bar D}$ pairs near their respective thresholds in $e^+e^-$ annihilation. We consider here a realistic situation with a resonant interaction in the isospin I=0 channel and a nonresonant strong scattering amplitude in the I=1 state. We find that the yield ratio has a smooth behavior depending on the scattering phase in the I=1 channel. The same approach is also applicable to the $K {\bar K}$ production at the $\phi(1020)$ resonance, where the Coulomb effect in the charged-to-neutral yield ratio is generally sensitive to the scattering phases in both the isoscalar and the isovector channels. Furthermore, we apply the same approach to the treatment of the effect of the isotopic mass difference between the charged and neutral mesons and argue that the strong-scattering effects generally result in a modification to the pure kinematical effect of this mass difference.
293|QED x QCD Resummation and Shower/ME Matching for LHC Physics|B.F.L. Ward and S.A. Yost|We present the theory of QED x QCD resummation and its interplay with shower/matrix element matching in precision LHC physics scenarios. We illustrate the theory using single heavy gauge boson production at hadron colliders.
294|On the number of topological types occurring in a parametrized family of   arrangements|Saugata Basu|Let ${\mathcal S}(\R)$ be an o-minimal structure over $\R$, $T \subset \R^{k_1+k_2+\ell}$ a closed definable set, and $$ \displaylines{\pi_1: \R^{k_1+k_2+\ell}\to \R^{k_1 + k_2}, \pi_2: \R^{k_1+k_2+\ell}\to \R^{\ell}, \ \pi_3: \R^{k_1 + k_2} \to \R^{k_2}} $$ the projection maps.   For any collection ${\mathcal A} = \{A_1,...,A_n\}$ of subsets of $\R^{k_1+k_2}$, and $\z \in \R^{k_2}$, let $\A_\z$ denote the collection of subsets of $\R^{k_1}$, $\{A_{1,\z},..., A_{n,\z}\}$, where $A_{i,\z} = A_i \cap \pi_3^{-1}(\z), 1 \leq i \leq n$. We prove that there exists a constant $C = C(T) > 0,$ such that for any family ${\mathcal A} = \{A_1,...,A_n\}$ of definable sets, where each $A_i = \pi_1(T \cap \pi_2^{-1}(\y_i))$, for some $\y_i \in \R^{\ell}$, the number of distinct stable homotopy types of $\A_\z, \z \in \R^{k_2}$, is bounded by $ \displaystyle{C \cdot n^{(k_1+1)k_2},} $ while the number of distinct homotopy types is bounded by $ \displaystyle{C \cdot n^{(k_1+3)k_2}.} $ This generalizes to the general o-minimal setting, bounds of the same type proved in \cite{BV} for semi-algebraic and semi-Pfaffian families. One main technical tool used in the proof of the above results, is a topological comparison theorem which might be of independent interest in the study of arrangements.
295|Generalized Twistor Transform And Dualities, With A New Description of   Particles With Spin, Beyond Free and Massless|Itzhak Bars and Bora Orcal|A generalized twistor transform for spinning particles in 3+1 dimensions is constructed that beautifully unifies many types of spinning systems by mapping them to the same twistor, thus predicting an infinite set of duality relations among spinning systems with different Hamiltonians. Usual 1T-physics is not equipped to explain the duality relationships and unification between these systems. We use 2T-physics in 4+2 dimensions to uncover new properties of twistors, and expect that our approach will prove to be useful for practical applications as well as for a deeper understanding of fundamental physics. Unexpected structures for a new description of spinning particles emerge. A unifying symmetry SU(2,3) that includes conformal symmetry SU(2,2)=SO(4,2) in the massless case, turns out to be a fundamental property underlying the dualities of a large set of spinning systems, including those that occur in high spin theories. This may lead to new forms of string theory backgrounds as well as to new methods for studying various corners of M theory. In this paper we present the main concepts, and in a companion paper we give other details.
296|Remnant evolution after a carbon-oxygen white dwarf merger|Sung-Chul Yoon, Philipp Podsiadlowski and Stephan Rosswog|We systematically explore the evolution of the merger of two carbon-oxygen (CO) white dwarfs. The dynamical evolution of a 0.9 Msun + 0.6 Msun CO white dwarf merger is followed by a three-dimensional SPH simulation. We use an elaborate prescription in which artificial viscosity is essentially absent, unless a shock is detected, and a much larger number of SPH particles than earlier calculations. Based on this simulation, we suggest that the central region of the merger remnant can, once it has reached quasi-static equilibrium, be approximated as a differentially rotating CO star, which consists of a slowly rotating cold core and a rapidly rotating hot envelope surrounded by a centrifugally supported disc. We construct a model of the CO remnant that mimics the results of the SPH simulation using a one-dimensional hydrodynamic stellar evolution code and then follow its secular evolution. The stellar evolution models indicate that the growth of the cold core is controlled by neutrino cooling at the interface between the core and the hot envelope, and that carbon ignition in the envelope can be avoided despite high effective accretion rates. This result suggests that the assumption of forced accretion of cold matter that was adopted in previous studies of the evolution of double CO white dwarf merger remnants may not be appropriate. Our results imply that at least some products of double CO white dwarfs merger may be considered good candidates for the progenitors of Type Ia supernovae. In this case, the characteristic time delay between the initial dynamical merger and the eventual explosion would be ~10^5 yr. (Abridged).
297|Direct Theorems in the Theory of Approximation of the Banach Space   Vectors by Entire Vectors of Exponential Type|Ya. Grushka and S. Torba|For an arbitrary operator A on a Banach space X which is a generator of C_0-group with certain growth condition at the infinity, the direct theorems on connection between the smoothness degree of a vector $x\in X$ with respect to the operator A, the order of convergence to zero of the best approximation of x by exponential type entire vectors for the operator A, and the k-module of continuity are given. Obtained results allows to acquire Jackson-type inequalities in many classic spaces of periodic functions and weighted $L_p$ spaces.
298|Parametrized Post-Newtonian Expansion of Chern-Simons Gravity|Stephon Alexander and Nicolas Yunes|We investigate the weak-field, post-Newtonian expansion to the solution of the field equations in Chern-Simons gravity with a perfect fluid source. In particular, we study the mapping of this solution to the parameterized post-Newtonian formalism to 1 PN order in the metric. We find that the PPN parameters of Chern-Simons gravity are identical to those of general relativity, with the exception of the inclusion of a new term that is proportional to the Chern-Simons coupling parameter and the curl of the PPN vector potentials. We also find that the new term is naturally enhanced by the non-linearity of spacetime and we provide a physical interpretation for it. By mapping this correction to the gravito-electro-magnetic framework, we study the corrections that this new term introduces to the acceleration of point particles and the frame-dragging effect in gyroscopic precession. We find that the Chern-Simons correction to these classical predictions could be used by current and future experiments to place bounds on intrinsic parameters of Chern-Simons gravity and, thus, string theory.
299|Scaling of Resistance and Electron Mean Free Path of Single-Walled   Carbon Nanotubes|Meninder Purewal, Byung Hee Hong, Anirudhh Ravi, Bhupesh Chandra,   James Hone, and Philip Kim|We present an experimental investigation on the scaling of resistance in individual single walled carbon nanotube devices with channel lengths that vary four orders of magnitude on the same sample. The electron mean free path is obtained from the linear scaling of resistance with length at various temperatures. The low temperature mean free path is determined by impurity scattering, while at high temperature the mean free path decreases with increasing temperature, indicating that it is limited by electron-phonon scattering. An unusually long mean free path at room temperature has been experimentally confirmed. Exponentially increasing resistance with length at extremely long length scales suggests anomalous localization effects.
300|Differential Recursion and Differentially Algebraic Functions|Akitoshi Kawamura|Moore introduced a class of real-valued "recursive" functions by analogy with Kleene's formulation of the standard recursive functions. While his concise definition inspired a new line of research on analog computation, it contains some technical inaccuracies. Focusing on his "primitive recursive" functions, we pin down what is problematic and discuss possible attempts to remove the ambiguity regarding the behavior of the differential recursion operator on partial functions. It turns out that in any case the purported relation to differentially algebraic functions, and hence to Shannon's model of analog computation, fails.
301|Spline Single-Index Prediction Model|Li Wang and Lijian Yang|For the past two decades, single-index model, a special case of projection pursuit regression, has proven to be an efficient way of coping with the high dimensional problem in nonparametric regression. In this paper, based on weakly dependent sample, we investigate the single-index prediction (SIP) model which is robust against deviation from the single-index model. The single-index is identified by the best approximation to the multivariate prediction function of the response variable, regardless of whether the prediction function is a genuine single-index function. A polynomial spline estimator is proposed for the single-index prediction coefficients, and is shown to be root-n consistent and asymptotically normal. An iterative optimization routine is used which is sufficiently fast for the user to analyze large data of high dimension within seconds. Simulation experiments have provided strong evidence that corroborates with the asymptotic theory. Application of the proposed procedure to the rive flow data of Iceland has yielded superior out-of-sample rolling forecasts.
302|Measurement of the Aerosol Phase Function at the Pierre Auger   Observatory|S.Y. BenZvi, B.M. Connolly, J.A.J. Matthews, M. Prouza, E.F. Visbal,   S. Westerhoff|Air fluorescence detectors measure the energy of ultra-high energy cosmic rays by collecting fluorescence light emitted from nitrogen molecules along the extensive air shower cascade. To ensure a reliable energy determination, the light signal needs to be corrected for atmospheric effects, which not only attenuate the signal, but also produce a non-negligible background component due to scattered Cherenkov light and multiple-scattered light. The correction requires regular measurements of the aerosol attenuation length and the aerosol phase function, defined as the probability of light scattered in a given direction. At the Pierre Auger Observatory in Malargue, Argentina, the phase function is measured on an hourly basis using two Aerosol Phase Function (APF) light sources. These sources direct a UV light beam across the field of view of the fluorescence detectors; the phase function can be extracted from the image of the shots in the fluorescence detector cameras. This paper describes the design, current status, standard operation procedure, and performance of the APF system at the Pierre Auger Observatory.
303|The World as Evolving Information|Carlos Gershenson|This paper discusses the benefits of describing the world as information, especially in the study of the evolution of life and cognition. Traditional studies encounter problems because it is difficult to describe life and cognition in terms of matter and energy, since their laws are valid only at the physical scale. However, if matter and energy, as well as life and cognition, are described in terms of information, evolution can be described consistently as information becoming more complex.   The paper presents eight tentative laws of information, valid at multiple scales, which are generalizations of Darwinian, cybernetic, thermodynamic, psychological, philosophical, and complexity principles. These are further used to discuss the notions of life, cognition and their evolution.
304|Polymerization Force Driven Buckling of Microtubule Bundles Determines   the Wavelength of Patterns Formed in Tubulin Solutions|Yongxing Guo, Yifeng Liu, Jay X. Tang, and James M. Valles Jr|We present a model for the spontaneous formation of a striated pattern in polymerizing microtubule solutions. It describes the buckling of a single microtubule (MT) bundle within an elastic network formed by other similarly aligned and buckling bundles and unaligned MTs. Phase contrast and polarization microscopy studies of the temporal evolution of the pattern imply that the polymerization of MTs within the bundles creates the driving compressional force. Using the measured rate of buckling, the established MT force-velocity curve and the pattern wavelength, we obtain reasonable estimates for the MT bundle bending rigidity and the elastic constant of the network. The analysis implies that the bundles buckle as solid rods.
305|Neutron Inelastic Scattering Processes as Background for Double-Beta   Decay Experiments|D.-M. Mei, S.R. Elliott, A. Hime, V. Gehman and K. Kazkaz|We investigate several Pb$(n,n'\gamma$) and Ge$(n,n'\gamma$) reactions. We measure $\gamma$-ray production from Pb$(n,n'\gamma$) reactions that can be a significant background for double-beta decay experiments which use lead as a massive inner shield. Particularly worrisome for Ge-based double-beta decay experiments are the 2041-keV and 3062-keV $\gamma$ rays produced via Pb$(n,n'\gamma$). The former is very close to the ^{76}Ge double-beta decay endpoint energy and the latter has a double escape peak energy near the endpoint. Excitation $\gamma$-ray lines from Ge$(n,n'\gamma$) reactions are also observed. We consider the contribution of such backgrounds and their impact on the sensitivity of next-generation searches for neutrinoless double-beta decay using enriched germanium detectors.
306|Periodic accretion from a circumbinary disk in the young binary UZ Tau E|Eric L. N. Jensen (1), Saurav Dhital (1,2), Keivan G. Stassun (2),   Jenny Patience (3), William Herbst (4), Frederick M. Walter (5), Michal Simon   (5), Gibor Basri (6); (1 - Swarthmore College; 2 - Vanderbilt; 3 - Caltech; 4   - Wesleyan University; 5 - SUNY Stony Brook; 6 - UC Berkeley)|Close pre-main-sequence binary stars are expected to clear central holes in their protoplanetary disks, but the extent to which material can flow from the circumbinary disk across the gap onto the individual circumstellar disks has been unclear. In binaries with eccentric orbits, periodic perturbation of the outer disk is predicted to induce mass flow across the gap, resulting in accretion that varies with the binary period. This accretion may manifest itself observationally as periodic changes in luminosity. Here we present a search for such periodic accretion in the pre-main-sequence spectroscopic binary UZ Tau E. We present BVRI photometry spanning three years; we find that the brightness of UZ Tau E is clearly periodic, with a best-fit period of 19.16 +/- 0.04 days. This is consistent with the spectroscopic binary period of 19.13 days, refined here from analysis of new and existing radial velocity data. The brightness of UZ Tau E shows significant random variability, but the overall periodic pattern is a broad peak in enhanced brightness, spanning more than half the binary orbital period. The variability of the H-alpha line is not as clearly periodic, but given the sparseness of the data, some periodic component is not ruled out. The photometric variations are in good agreement with predictions from simulations of binaries with orbital parameters similar to those of UZ Tau E, suggesting that periodic accretion does occur from circumbinary disks, replenishing the inner disks and possibly extending the timescale over which they might form planets.
307|Effect of node deleting on network structure|Ke Deng, Heping Zhao, Dejun Li|The ever-increasing knowledge of the structure of various real-world networks has uncovered their complex multi-mechanism-governed evolution processes. Therefore, a better understanding of the structure and evolution of these networked complex systems requires us to describe such processes in a more detailed and realistic manner. In this paper, we introduce a new type of network growth rule which comprises addition and deletion of nodes, and propose an evolving network model to investigate the effect of node deleting on network structure. It is found that, with the introduction of node deleting, network structure is significantly transformed. In particular, degree distribution of the network undergoes a transition from scale-free to exponential forms as the intensity of node deleting increases. At the same time, nontrivial disassortative degree correlation develops spontaneously as a natural result of network evolution in the model. We also demonstrate that node deleting introduced in the model does not destroy the connectedness of a growing network so long as the increasing rate of edges is not excessively small. In addition, it is found that node deleting will weaken but not eliminate the small-world effect of a growing network, and generally it will decrease the clustering coefficient in a network.
308|The Complexity of HCP in Digraps with Degree Bound Two|Guohun Zhu|The Hamiltonian cycle problem (HCP) in digraphs D with degree bound two is solved by two mappings in this paper. The first bijection is between an incidence matrix C_{nm} of simple digraph and an incidence matrix F of balanced bipartite undirected graph G; The second mapping is from a perfect matching of G to a cycle of D. It proves that the complexity of HCP in D is polynomial, and finding a second non-isomorphism Hamiltonian cycle from a given Hamiltonian digraph with degree bound two is also polynomial. Lastly it deduces P=NP base on the results.
309|VLBI observations of nineteen GHz-Peaked-Spectrum radio sources at 1.6   GHz|Xiang Liu, Lang Cui, Wen-Feng Luo, Wei-Zhao Shi, Hua-Gang Song (Urumqi   Observatory, NAOC)|Aims and Methods: We present the results of VLBI observations of nineteen GHz-Peaked-Spectrum (GPS) radio sources at 1.6 GHz. Of them, 15 sources are selected from the Parkes Half Jansky (PHJ) sample (Snellen 2002), 4 others are from our previous observation list. We aimed at imaging the structure of GPS sources, searching for Compact Symmetric Objects (CSOs) and studying the absorption for the convex radio spectra of GPS sources.   Results: We obtained total intensity 1.6 GHz VLBI images of 17 sources for the first time. Of them, 80% show mini-double-lobe radio structure, indicating that they are CSOs or candidates, and their host AGNs could be edge-on to us. This result suggests that there is a high incidence of mini double-lobe sources (or CSOs) in the PHJ sample. The sources J0323+0534, J1135-0021, J1352+0232, J2058+0540, J2123-0112 and J2325-0344 with measured redshift, showing double-lobe structure with sizes of <1 kpc, are classified as CSOs. Three sources J1057+0012, J1600-0037 and J1753+2750 are considered as core-jet sources according to their morphologies and flux variability.
310|Moment switching in nanotube magnetic force probes|John R. Kirtley, Zhifeng Deng, Lan Luan, Erhan Yenilmez, Hongjie Dai,   and Kathryn A. Moler|A recent advance in improving the spatial resolution of magnetic force microscopy (MFM) uses as sensor tips carbon nanotubes grown at the apex of conventional silicon cantilever pyramids and coated with a thin ferromagnetic layer. Magnetic images of high density vertically recorded media using these tips exhibit a doubling of the spatial frequency under some conditions. Here we demonstrate that this spatial frequency doubling is due to the switching of the moment direction of the nanotube tip. This results in a signal which is proportional to the absolute value of the signal normally observed in MFM. Our modeling indicates that a significant fraction of the tip volume is involved in the observed switching, and that it should be possible to image very high bit densities with nanotube magnetic force sensors.
311|Power Spectra to 1% Accuracy between Dynamical Dark Energy Cosmologies|Matthew J. Francis, Geraint F. Lewis, Eric V. Linder|For dynamical dark energy cosmologies we carry out a series of N-body gravitational simulations, achieving percent level accuracy in the relative mass power spectra at any redshift. Such accuracy in the power spectrum is necessary for next generation cosmological mass probes. Our matching procedure reproduces the CMB distance to last scattering and delivers subpercent level power spectra at z=0 and z~3. We discuss the physical implications for probing dark energy with surveys of large scale structure.
312|Possibility of Gapless Spin Liquid State by One-dimensionalization|Yuta Hayashi, Masao Ogata|Motivated by the observation of a gapless spin liquid state in $\kappa$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$Cu$_2$(CN)$_3$, we analyze the anisotropic triangular lattice $S=1/2$ Heisenberg model with the resonating valence bond mean-field approximation. Paying attention to the small quasi-one-dimensional anisotropy of the material, we take an approach from one-dimensional (1D) chains coupled with frustrating zig-zag bonds. By calculating one-particle excitation spectra changing anisotropy parameter $J'/J$ from the decoupled 1D chains to the isotropic triangular lattice, we find almost gapless excitations in the wide range from the 1D limit. This one-dimensionalization by frustration is considered to be a candidate for the mechanism of the gapless spin liquid state.
313|Extra dimensions and Lorentz invariance violation|Viktor Baukh, Alexander Zhuk, Tina Kahniashvili|We consider effective model where photons interact with scalar field corresponding to conformal excitations of the internal space (geometrical moduli/gravexcitons). We demonstrate that this interaction results in a modified dispersion relation for photons, and consequently, the photon group velocity depends on the energy implying the propagation time delay effect. We suggest to use the experimental bounds of the time delay of gamma ray bursts (GRBs) photons propagation as an additional constrain for the gravexciton parameters.
314|The small deviations of many-dimensional diffusion processes and   rarefaction by boundaries|Vitalii A. Gasanenko|We lead the algorithm of expansion of sojourn probability of many-dimensional diffusion processes in small domain. The principal member of this expansion defines normalizing coefficient for special limit theorems.
315|The Millennium Galaxy Catalogue: The local supermassive black hole mass   function in early- and late-type galaxies|Alister W. Graham, Simon P. Driver, Paul D. Allen, Jochen Liske|We provide a new estimate of the local supermassive black hole mass function using (i) the empirical relation between supermassive black hole mass and the Sersic index of the host spheroidal stellar system and (ii) the measured (spheroid) Sersic indices drawn from 10k galaxies in the Millennium Galaxy Catalogue. The observational simplicity of our approach, and the direct measurements of the black hole predictor quantity, i.e. the Sersic index, for both elliptical galaxies and the bulges of disc galaxies makes it straightforward to estimate accurate black hole masses in early- and late-type galaxies alike. We have parameterised the supermassive black hole mass function with a Schechter function and find, at the low-mass end, a logarithmic slope (1+alpha) of ~0.7 for the full galaxy sample and ~1.0 for the early-type galaxy sample. Considering spheroidal stellar systems brighter than M_B = -18 mag, and integrating down to black hole masses of 10^6 M_sun, we find that the local mass density of supermassive black holes in early-type galaxies rho_{bh, early-type} = (3.5+/-1.2) x 10^5 h^3_{70} M_sun Mpc^{-3}, and in late-type galaxies rho_{bh, late-type} = (1.0+/-0.5) x 10^5 h^3_{70} M_sun Mpc^{-3}. The uncertainties are derived from Monte Carlo simulations which include uncertainties in the M_bh-n relation, the catalogue of Sersic indices, the galaxy weights and Malmquist bias. The combined, cosmological, supermassive black hole mass density is thus Omega_{bh, total} = (3.2+/-1.2) x 10^{-6} h_70. That is, using a new and independent method, we conclude that (0.007+/-0.003) h^3_{70} per cent of the universe's baryons are presently locked up in supermassive black holes at the centres of galaxies.
316|Complete Shrinking Ricci Solitons have Finite Fundamental Group|William Wylie|We show that if a complete Riemannian manifold supports a vector field such that the Ricci tensor plus the Lie derivative of the metric with respect to the vector field has a positive lower bound, then the fundamental group is finite. In particular, it follows that complete shrinking Ricci solitons and complete smooth metric measure spaces with a positive lower bound on the Bakry-Emery tensor have finite fundamental group. The method of proof is to generalize arguments of Garcia-Rio and Fernandez-Lopez in the compact case.
317|Effects of Dirac sea on pion propagation in asymmetric nuclear matter|Subhrajyoti Biswas and Abhee K. Dutt-Mazumder|We study pion propagation in asymmetric nuclear matter (ANM). One of the interesting consequences of pion propagation in ANM is the mode splitting for the different charged states of pions. First we describe the pion-nucleon dynamics using the non-chiral model where one starts with pseudoscalar (PS) $\pi$N coupling and the pseudovector (PV) representation is obtained via suitable non-linear field transformations. For both of these cases the effect of the Dirac sea is estimated. Subsequently, we present results using the chiral effective Lagrangian where the short-distance behavior (Dirac vacuum) is included by re-defining the field parameters as done in the modern effective field theory approach developed recently. The results are compared with the previous calculations for the case of symmetric nuclear matter (SNM). Closed form analytical results are presented for the effective pion masses and dispersion relations by making hard nucleon loop (HNL) approximation and suitable density expansion.
318|Spin-orbit coupling effect on the persistent currents in mesoscopic ring   with an Anderson impurity|Guo-Hui Ding and Bing Dong|Based on the finite $U$ slave boson method, we have investigated the effect of Rashba spin-orbit(SO) coupling on the persistent charge and spin currents in mesoscopic ring with an Anderson impurity. It is shown that the Kondo effect will decrease the magnitude of the persistent charge and spin currents in this side-coupled Anderson impurity case. In the presence of SO coupling, the persistent currents change drastically and oscillate with the strength of SO coupling. The SO coupling will suppress the Kondo effect and restore the abrupt jumps of the persistent currents. It is also found that a persistent spin current circulating the ring can exist even without the charge current in this system.
319|Probability distributions generated by fractional diffusion equations|Francesco Mainardi, Paolo Paradisi and Rudolf Gorenflo|Fractional calculus allows one to generalize the linear, one-dimensional, diffusion equation by replacing either the first time derivative or the second space derivative by a derivative of fractional order. The fundamental solutions of these equations provide probability density functions, evolving on time or variable in space, which are related to the class of stable distributions. This property is a noteworthy generalization of what happens for the standard diffusion equation and can be relevant in treating financial and economical problems where the stable probability distributions play a key role.
320|Fabrication of half metallicity in a ferromagnetic metal|Kalobaran Maiti|We investigate the growth of half metallic phase in a ferromagnetic material using state-of-the-art full potential linearized augmented plane wave method. To address the issue, we have substituted Ti at the Ru-sites in SrRuO3, where SrRuO3 is a ferromagnetic material. Calculated results establish Ti4+ valence states (similar to SrTiO3), which was predicted experimentally. Thus, Ti substitution dilutes the Ru-O-Ru connectivity, which is manifested in the calculated results in the form of significant band narrowing leading to finite gap between t2g and eg bands. At 75% substitution, a large gap (> 2 eV) appears at the Fermi level, e_F in the up spin density of states, while the down spin states contributes at e_F characterizing the system a half-metallic ferromagnet. The t2g - eg gap can be tailored judiciously by tuning Ti concentrations to minimize thermal effects, which is often the major bottleneck to achieve high spin polarization at elevated temperatures in other materials. This study, thus, provides a novel but simple way to fabricate half-metallicity in ferromagnetic materials, which are potential candidates for spin-based technology.
321|Emergence of spatiotemporal chaos driven by far-field breakup of spiral   waves in the plankton ecological systems|Quan-Xing Liu, Gui-Quan Sun, Bai-Lian Li and Zhen Jin|Alexander B. Medvinsky \emph{et al} [A. B. Medvinsky, I. A. Tikhonova, R. R. Aliev, B.-L. Li, Z.-S. Lin, and H. Malchow, Phys. Rev. E \textbf{64}, 021915 (2001)] and Marcus R. Garvie \emph{et al} [M. R. Garvie and C. Trenchea, SIAM J. Control. Optim. \textbf{46}, 775-791 (2007)] shown that the minimal spatially extended reaction-diffusion model of phytoplankton-zooplankton can exhibit both regular, chaotic behavior, and spatiotemporal patterns in a patchy environment. Based on that, the spatial plankton model is furtherly investigated by means of computer simulations and theoretical analysis in the present paper when its parameters would be expected in the case of mixed Turing-Hopf bifurcation region. Our results show that the spiral waves exist in that region and the spatiotemporal chaos emerge, which arise from the far-field breakup of the spiral waves over large ranges of diffusion coefficients of phytoplankton and zooplankton. Moreover, the spatiotemporal chaos arising from the far-field breakup of spiral waves does not gradually involve the whole space within that region. Our results are confirmed by means of computation spectra and nonlinear bifurcation of wave trains. Finally, we give some explanations about the spatially structured patterns from the community level.
322|General sequential quantum cloning|Gui-Fang Dang, and Heng Fan|Some multipartite quantum states can be generated in a sequential manner which may be implemented by various physical setups like microwave and optical cavity QED, trapped ions, and quantum dots etc. We analyze the general N to M qubits Universal Quantum Cloning Machine (UQCM) within a sequential generation scheme. We show that the N to M sequential UQCM is available. The case of d-level quantum states sequential cloning is also presented.
323|On the pseudospectrum of elliptic quadratic differential operators|Karel Pravda-Starov|We study the pseudospectrum of a class of non-selfadjoint differential operators. Our work consists in a detailed study of the microlocal properties, which rule the spectral stability or instability phenomena appearing under small perturbations for elliptic quadratic differential operators. The class of elliptic quadratic differential operators stands for the class of operators defined in the Weyl quantization by complex-valued elliptic quadratic symbols. We establish in this paper a simple necessary and sufficient condition on the Weyl symbol of these operators, which ensures the stability of their spectra. When this condition is violated, we prove that it occurs some strong spectral instabilities for the high energies of these operators, in some regions which can be far away from their spectra. We give a precise geometrical description of them, which explains the results obtained for these operators in some numerical simulations giving the computation of false eigenvalues far from their spectra by algorithms for eigenvalues computing.
324|Fluctuation-dissipation relation on a Melde string in a turbulent flow,   considerations on a "dynamical temperature"|Vincent Grenard (Phys-ENS), Nicolas Garnier (Phys-ENS), Antoine Naert   (Phys-ENS)|We report on measurements of the transverse fluctuations of a string in a turbulent air jet flow. Harmonic modes are excited by the fluctuating drag force, at different wave-numbers. This simple mechanical probe makes it possible to measure excitations of the flow at specific scales, averaged over space and time: it is a scale-resolved, global measurement. We also measure the dissipation associated to the string motion, and we consider the ratio of the fluctuations over dissipation (FDR). In an exploratory approach, we investigate the concept of {\it effective temperature} defined through the FDR. We compare our observations with other definitions of temperature in turbulence. From the theory of Kolmogorov (1941), we derive the exponent -11/3 expected for the spectrum of the fluctuations. This simple model and our experimental results are in good agreement, over the range of wave-numbers, and Reynolds number accessible ($74000 \leq Re \leq 170000$).
325|On generalized entropy measures and pathways|A.M. Mathai, H.J. Haubold|Product probability property, known in the literature as statistical independence, is examined first. Then generalized entropies are introduced, all of which give generalizations to Shannon entropy. It is shown that the nature of the recursivity postulate automatically determines the logarithmic functional form for Shannon entropy. Due to the logarithmic nature, Shannon entropy naturally gives rise to additivity, when applied to situations having product probability property. It is argued that the natural process is non-additivity, important, for example, in statistical mechanics, even in product probability property situations and additivity can hold due to the involvement of a recursivity postulate leading to a logarithmic function. Generalizations, including Mathai's generalized entropy are introduced and some of the properties are examined. Situations are examined where Mathai's entropy leads to pathway models, exponential and power law behavior and related differential equations. Connection of Mathai's entropy to Kerridge's measure of "inaccuracy" is also explored.
326|Evolution of a band insulating phase from a correlated metallic phase|Kalobaran Maiti, Ravi Shankar Singh, V.R.R. Medicherla|We investigate the evolution of the electronic structure in SrRu_(1-x)Ti_xO_3 as a function of x using high resolution photoemission spectroscopy, where SrRuO3 is a weakly correlated metal and SrTiO3 is a band insulator. The surface spectra exhibit a metal-insulator transition at x = 0.5 by opening up a soft gap. A hard gap appears at higher x values consistent with the transport properties. In contrast, the bulk spectra reveal a pseudogap at the Fermi level, and unusual evolution exhibiting an apparent broadening of the coherent feature and subsequent decrease in intensity of the lower Hubbard band with the increase in x. Interestingly, the first principle approaches are found to be sufficient to capture anomalous evolutions at high energy scale. Analysis of the spectral lineshape indicates strong interplay between disorder and electron correlation in the electronic properties of this system.
327|Electroweak phase transitions in the MSSM with an extra $U(1)'$|S.W. Ham, E.J. Yoo, S.K. OH|We investigate the possibility of electroweak phase transition in the minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM) with an extra $U(1)'$. This model has two Higgs doublets and a singlet, in addition to a singlet exotic quark superfield. We find that at the one-loop level this model may accommodate the electroweak phase transitions that are strongly first-order in a reasonably large region of the parameter space. In the parameter region where the phase transitions take place, we observe that the lightest scalar Higgs boson has a smaller mass when the strength of the phase transition becomes weaker. Also, the other three heavier neutral Higgs bosons get more large masses when the strength of the phase transition becomes weaker.
328|Solutions of fractional reaction-diffusion equations in terms of the   H-function|H.J. Haubold, A.M. Mathai, R.K. Saxena|This paper deals with the investigation of the solution of an unified fractional reaction-diffusion equation associated with the Caputo derivative as the time-derivative and Riesz-Feller fractional derivative as the space-derivative. The solution is derived by the application of the Laplace and Fourier transforms in closed form in terms of the H-function. The results derived are of general nature and include the results investigated earlier by many authors, notably by Mainardi et al. (2001, 2005) for the fundamental solution of the space-time fractional diffusion equation, and Saxena et al. (2006a, b) for fractional reaction- diffusion equations. The advantage of using Riesz-Feller derivative lies in the fact that the solution of the fractional reaction-diffusion equation containing this derivative includes the fundamental solution for space-time fractional diffusion, which itself is a generalization of neutral fractional diffusion, space-fractional diffusion, and time-fractional diffusion. These specialized types of diffusion can be interpreted as spatial probability density functions evolving in time and are expressible in terms of the H-functions in compact form.
329|Random Matrix Theory at Nonzero $\mu$ and $T$|K. Splittorff and J.J.M. Verbaarschot|We review applications of random matrix theory to QCD at nonzero temperature and chemical potential. The chiral phase transition of QCD and QCD-like theories is discussed in terms of eigenvalues of the Dirac operator. We show that for QCD at $\mu \ne 0$, which has a sign problem, the discontinuity in the chiral condensate is due to an alternative to the Banks-Casher relation. The severity of the sign problem is analyzed in the microscopic domain of QCD.
330|Symmetries by base substitutions in the genetic code predict 2' or 3'   aminoacylation of tRNAs|J.-L. Jestin, C. Soule (IHES)|This letter reports complete sets of two-fold symmetries between partitions of the universal genetic code. By substituting bases at each position of the codons according to a fixed rule, it happens that properties of the degeneracy pattern or of tRNA aminoacylation specificity are exchanged.
331|The effect of a fifth large-scale space-time dimension on the   conservation of energy in a four dimensional Universe|M.B. Gerrard and T.J. Sumner|The effect of introducing a fifth large-scale space-time dimension to the equations of orbital dynamics was analysed in an earlier paper by the authors. The results showed good agreement with the observed flat rotation curves of galaxies and the Pioneer Anomaly. This analysis did not require the modification of Newtonian dynamics, but rather only their restatement in a five dimensional framework. The same analysis derived a acceleration parameter ar, which plays an important role in the restated equations of orbital dynamics, and suggested a value for ar. In this companion paper, the principle of conservation of energy is restated within the same five-dimensional framework. The resulting analysis provides an alternative route to estimating the value of ar, without reference to the equations of orbital dynamics, and based solely on key cosmological constants and parameters, including the gravitational constant, G. The same analysis suggests that: (i) the inverse square law of gravity may itself be due to the conservation of energy at the boundary between a four-dimensional universe and a fifth large-scale space-time dimension; and (ii) there is a limiting case for the Tulley-Fisher relationship linking the speed of light to the mass of the Universe.
332|Optical properties of the Holstein-t-J model from dynamical mean-field   theory|E. Cappelluti, S. Ciuchi, S. Fratini|We employ dynamical mean-field theory to study the optical conductivity $\sigma(\omega)$ of one hole in the Holstein-t-J model. We provide an exact solution for $\sigma(\omega)$ in the limit of infinite connectivity. We apply our analysis to Nd$_{2-x}$Ce$_x$CuO$_4$. We show that our model can explain many features of the optical conductivity in this compounds in terms of magnetic/lattice polaron formation.
333|A Multiphilic Descriptor for Chemical Reactivity and Selectivity|J. Padmanabhan (1,2), R. Parthasarathi (2), M. Elango (2), V.   Subramanian (2), B. S. Krishnamoorthy (1,3), S. Gutierrez-Oliva (4), A.   Toro-Labbe (4), D. R. Roy (1) and P. K. Chattaraj (1)|In line with the local philicity concept proposed by Chattaraj et al. (Chattaraj, P. K.; Maiti, B.; Sarkar, U. J. Phys. Chem. A. 2003, 107, 4973) and a dual descriptor derived by Toro-Labbe and coworkers (Morell, C.; Grand, A.; Toro-Labbe, A. J. Phys. Chem. A. 2005, 109, 205), we propose a multiphilic descriptor. It is defined as the difference between nucleophilic (Wk+) and electrophilic (Wk-) condensed philicity functions. This descriptor is capable of simultaneously explaining the nucleophilicity and electrophilicity of the given atomic sites in the molecule. Variation of these quantities along the path of a soft reaction is also analyzed. Predictive ability of this descriptor has been successfully tested on the selected systems and reactions. Corresponding force profiles are also analyzed in some representative cases. Also, to study the intra- and intermolecular reactivities another related descriptor namely, the nucleophilicity excess (DelW-+) for a nucleophile, over the electrophilicity in it has been defined and tested on all-metal aromatic compounds.
334|Approximation of the distribution of a stationary Markov process with   application to option pricing|Gilles Pag\`es (PMA, LSProba), Fabien Panloup (PMA)|We build a sequence of empirical measures on the space D(R_+,R^d) of R^d-valued c\`adl\`ag functions on R_+ in order to approximate the law of a stationary R^d-valued Markov and Feller process (X_t). We obtain some general results of convergence of this sequence. Then, we apply them to Brownian diffusions and solutions to L\'evy driven SDE's under some Lyapunov-type stability assumptions. As a numerical application of this work, we show that this procedure gives an efficient way of option pricing in stochastic volatility models.
335|Influence of Phonon dimensionality on Electron Energy Relaxation|J. T. Karvonen and I. J. Maasilta|We studied experimentally the role of phonon dimensionality on electron-phonon (e-p) interaction in thin copper wires evaporated either on suspended silicon nitride membranes or on bulk substrates, at sub-Kelvin temperatures. The power emitted from electrons to phonons was measured using sensitive normal metal-insulator-superconductor (NIS) tunnel junction thermometers. Membrane thicknesses ranging from 30 nm to 750 nm were used to clearly see the onset of the effects of two-dimensional (2D) phonon system. We observed for the first time that a 2D phonon spectrum clearly changes the temperature dependence and strength of the e-p scattering rate, with the interaction becoming stronger at the lowest temperatures below $\sim$ 0.5 K for the 30 nm membranes.
336|Bursting Dynamics of the 3D Euler Equations in Cylindrical Domains|Fran\c{c}ois Golse (CMLS-EcolePolytechnique, LJLL), Alex Mahalov,   Basil Nicolaenko|A class of three-dimensional initial data characterized by uniformly large vorticity is considered for the Euler equations of incompressible fluids. The fast singular oscillating limits of the Euler equations are studied for parametrically resonant cylinders. Resonances of fast swirling Beltrami waves deplete the Euler nonlinearity. The resonant Euler equations are systems of three-dimensional rigid body equations, coupled or not. Some cases of these resonant systems have homoclinic cycles, and orbits in the vicinity of these homoclinic cycles lead to bursts of the Euler solution measured in Sobolev norms of order higher than that corresponding to the enstrophy.
337|Synergistic Effects of MoDTC and ZDTP on Frictional Behaviour of   Tribofilms at the Nanometer Scale|Sandrine Bec (LTDS), Andr\'e Tonck (LTDS), Jean-Marie Georges (LTDS),   Glyn W. Roper (SHELL)|The layered structure and the rheological properties of anti-wear films, generated in a rolling/sliding contact from lubricants containing zinc dialkyldithiophosphate (ZDTP) and/or molybdenum dialkyldithiocarbamate (MoDTC) additives, have been studied by dynamic nanoindentation experiments coupled with a simple modelling of the stiffness measurements. Local nano-friction experiments were conducted with the same device in order to determine the evolution of the friction coefficient as a function of the applied pressure for the different lubricant formulations. For the MoDTC film, the applied pressure in the friction test remains low (<0.5 GPa) and the apparent friction coefficient is high ($\mu$ > 0.4). For the tribofilms containing MoDTC together with ZDTP, which permits the applied pressure to increase up to a few GPa through some accommodation process, a very low friction domain appears (0.01 < $\mu$ < 0.05), located a few nanometers below the surface of the tribofilm. This low friction coefficient is attributed to the presence of MoS2 planes sliding over each other in a favourable configuration obtained when the pressure is sufficiently high, which is made possible by the presence of ZDTP.
338|Lattice Boltzmann inverse kinetic approach for the incompressible   Navier-Stokes equations|Enrico Fonda, Massimo Tessarotto and Marco Ellero|In spite of the large number of papers appeared in the past which are devoted to the lattice Boltzmann (LB) methods, basic aspects of the theory still remain unchallenged. An unsolved theoretical issue is related to the construction of a discrete kinetic theory which yields \textit{exactly} the fluid equations, i.e., is non-asymptotic (here denoted as \textit{LB inverse kinetic theory}). The purpose of this paper is theoretical and aims at developing an inverse kinetic approach of this type. In principle infinite solutions exist to this problem but the freedom can be exploited in order to meet important requirements. In particular, the discrete kinetic theory can be defined so that it yields exactly the fluid equation also for arbitrary non-equilibrium (but suitably smooth) kinetic distribution functions and arbitrarily close to the boundary of the fluid domain. Unlike previous entropic LB methods the theorem can be obtained without functional constraints on the class of the initial distribution functions. Possible realizations of the theory and asymptotic approximations are provided which permit to determine the fluid equations \textit{with prescribed accuracy.} As a result, asymptotic accuracy estimates of customary LB approaches and comparisons with the Chorin artificial compressibility method are discussed.
339|Phonon-mediated decay of an atom in a surface-induced potential|Fam Le Kien, S. Dutta Gupta, and K. Hakuta|We study phonon-mediated transitions between translational levels of an atom in a surface-induced potential. We present a general master equation governing the dynamics of the translational states of the atom. In the framework of the Debye model, we derive compact expressions for the rates for both upward and downward transitions. Numerical calculations for the transition rates are performed for a deep silica-induced potential allowing for a large number of bound levels as well as free states of a cesium atom. The total absorption rate is shown to be determined mainly by the bound-to-bound transitions for deep bound levels and by bound-to-free transitions for shallow bound levels. Moreover, the phonon emission and absorption processes can be orders of magnitude larger for deep bound levels as compared to the shallow bound ones. We also study various types of transitions from free states. We show that, for thermal atomic cesium with temperature in the range from 100 $\mu$K to 400 $\mu$K in the vicinity of a silica surface with temperature of 300 K, the adsorption (free-to-bound decay) rate is about two times larger than the heating (free-to-free upward decay) rate, while the cooling (free-to-free downward decay) rate is negligible.
340|Infrared Evolution Equations: Method and Applications|B.I. Ermolaev, M. Greco, S.I. Troyan|It is a brief review on composing and solving Infrared Evolution Equations. They can be used in order to calculate amplitudes of high-energy reactions in different kinematic regions in the double-logarithmic approximation.
341|Cofibrations in the Category of Frolicher Spaces. Part I|B. Dugmore and PP. Ntumba|Cofibrations are defined in the category of Fr\"olicher spaces by weakening the analog of the classical definition to enable smooth homotopy extensions to be more easily constructed, using flattened unit intervals. We later relate smooth cofibrations to smooth neighborhood deformation retracts. The notion of smooth neighborhood deformation retract gives rise to an analogous result that a closed Fr\"olicher subspace $A$ of the Fr\"olicher space $X$ is a smooth neighborhood deformation retract of $X$ if and only if the inclusion $i: A\hookrightarrow X$ comes from a certain subclass of cofibrations. As an application we construct the right Puppe sequence.
342|Experimental observation of structural crossover in binary mixtures of   colloidal hard spheres|J\"org Baumgartl, Roel P.A. Dullens, Marjolein Dijkstra, Roland Roth   and Clemens Bechinger|Using confocal-microscopy we investigate the structure of binary mixtures of colloidal hard spheres with size ratio q=0.61. As a function of the packing fraction of the two particle species, we observe a marked change of the dominant wavelength in the pair correlation function. This behavior is in excellent agreement with a recently predicted structural crossover in such mixtures. In addition, the repercussions of structural crossover on the real-space structure of a binary fluid are analyzed. We suggest a relation between crossover and the lateral extension of networks containing only equally sized particles that are connected by nearest neighbor bonds. This is supported by Monte-Carlo simulations which are performed at different packing fractions and size ratios.
343|The Blazar Spectral Sequence and GLAST|L. Maraschi, G. Ghisellini, F. Tavecchio|The present status and understanding of the "spectral sequence" of blazars is discussed in the perspective of the upcoming GLAST launch. The vast improvement in sensitivity will allow to i) determine more objectively the "average" gamma-ray properties of classes objects ii) probe more deeply the ratio between accretion power and jet power in different systems.
344|A High Robustness and Low Cost Model for Cascading Failures|Bing Wang, Beom Jun Kim|We study numerically the cascading failure problem by using artificially created scale-free networks and the real network structure of the power grid. The capacity for a vertex is assigned as a monotonically increasing function of the load (or the betweenness centrality). Through the use of a simple functional form with two free parameters, revealed is that it is indeed possible to make networks more robust while spending less cost. We suggest that our method to prevent cascade by protecting less vertices is particularly important for the design of more robust real-world networks to cascading failures.
345|Diffuse X-ray Emission from the Carina Nebula Observed with Suzaku|Kenji Hamaguchi, the Suzaku Eta Carinae team and the Carinae D-1 team|A number of giant HII regions are associated with soft diffuse X-ray emission. Among these, the Carina nebula possesses the brightest soft diffuse emission. The required plasma temperature and thermal energy can be produced by collisions or termination of fast winds from main-sequence or embedded young O stars, but the extended emission is often observed from regions apart from massive stellar clusters. The origin of the X-ray emission is unknown.   The XIS CCD camera onboard Suzaku has the best spectral resolution for extended soft sources so far, and is therefore capable of measuring key emission lines in the soft band. Suzaku observed the core and the eastern side of the Carina nebula (Car-D1) in 2005 Aug and 2006 June, respectively. Spectra of the south part of the core and Car-D1 similarly showed strong L-shell lines of iron ions and K-shell lines of silicon ions, while in the north of the core these lines were much weaker. Fitting the spectra with an absorbed thin-thermal plasma model showed kT~0.2, 0.6 keV and NH~1-2e21 cm-2 with a factor of 2-3 abundance variation in oxygen, magnesium, silicon and iron. The plasma might originate from an old supernova, or a super shell of multiple supernovae.
346|Resolvent estimates related with a class of dispersive equations|Hiroyuki Chihara|We present a simple proof of the resolvent estimates of elliptic Fourier multipliers on the Euclidean space, and apply them to the analysis of time-global and spatially-local smoothing estimates of a class of dispersive equations. For this purpose we study in detail the properties of the restriction of Fourier transform on the unit cotangent sphere associated with the symbols of multipliers.

348|The Colin de Verdi\`ere number and graphs of polytopes|Ivan Izmestiev|The Colin de Verdi\`ere number $\mu(G)$ of a graph $G$ is the maximum corank of a Colin de Verdi\`ere matrix for $G$ (that is, of a Schr\"odinger operator on $G$ with a single negative eigenvalue). In 2001, Lov\'asz gave a construction that associated to every convex 3-polytope a Colin de Verdi\`ere matrix of corank 3 for its 1-skeleton.   We generalize the Lov\'asz construction to higher dimensions by interpreting it as minus the Hessian matrix of the volume of the polar dual. As a corollary, $\mu(G) \ge d$ if $G$ is the 1-skeleton of a convex $d$-polytope.   Determination of the signature of the Hessian of the volume is based on the second Minkowski inequality for mixed volumes and on Bol's condition for equality.
349|Visible spectroscopic and photometric survey of Jupiter Trojans: final   results on dynamical families|S. Fornasier, E. Dotto, O. Hainaut, F. Marzari, H. Boehnhardt, F. De   Luise, M. A. Barucci|We present the results of a visible spectroscopic and photometric survey of Jupiter Trojans belonging to different dynamical families carried out at the ESO-NTT telescope. We obtained data on 47 objects, 23 belonging to the L5 swarm and 24 to the L4 one. These data together with those already published by Fornasier et al. (2004a) and Dotto et al. (2006), constitute a total sample of visible spectra for 80 objects. The survey allows us to investigate six families (Aneas, Anchises, Misenus, Phereclos, Sarpedon, Panthoos) in the L5 cloud and four L4 families (Eurybates, Menelaus, 1986 WD and 1986 TS6). The sample that we measured is dominated by D--type asteroids, with the exception of the Eurybates family in the L4 swarm, where there is a dominance of C- and P-type asteroids. All the spectra that we obtained are featureless with the exception of some Eurybates members, where a drop--off of the reflectance is detected shortward of 5200 A. Similar features are seen in main belt C-type asteroids and commonly attributed to the intervalence charge transfer transition in oxidized iron. Our sample comprises fainter and smaller Trojans as compared to the literature's data and allows us to investigate the properties of objects with estimated diameter smaller than 40--50 km. The analysis of the spectral slopes and colors versus the estimated diameters shows that the blue and red objects have indistinguishable size distribution. We perform a statistical investigation of the Trojans's spectra property distributions as a function of their orbital and physical parameters, and in comparison with other classes of minor bodies in the outer Solar System. Trojans at lower inclination appear significantly bluer than those at higher inclination, but this effect is strongly driven by the Eurybates family.
350|FIRST-based survey of Compact Steep Spectrum sources, V.   Milliarcsecond-scale morphology of CSS objects|Magdalena Kunert-Bajraszewska (1), Andrzej Marecki (1),((1) Torun   Centre for Astronomy, N. Copernicus University, Torun)|Multifrequency VLBA observations of the final group of ten objects in a sample of FIRST-based compact steep spectrum (CSS) sources are presented. The sample was selected to investigate whether objects of this kind could be relics of radio-loud AGNs switched off at very early stages of their evolution or possibly to indicate intermittent activity. Initial observations were made using MERLIN at 5 GHz. The sources have now been observed with the VLBA at 1.7, 5 and 8.4 GHz in a snapshot mode with phase-referencing. The resulting maps are presented along with unpublished 8.4-GHz VLA images of five sources. Some of the sources discussed here show a complex radio morphology and therefore a complicated past that, in some cases, might indicate intermittent activity. One of the sources studied - 1045+352 - is known as a powerful radio and infrared-luminous broad absorption line (BAL) quasar. It is a young CSS object whose asymmetric two-sided morphology on a scale of several hundred parsecs, extending in two different directions, may suggest intermittent activity. The young age and compact structure of 1045+352 is consistent with the evolution scenario of BAL quasars. It has also been confirmed that the submillimetre flux of 1045+352 can be seriously contaminated by synchrotron emission.
351|Investigation of relaxation phenomena in high-temperature   superconductors HoBa2Cu3O7-d at the action of pulsed magnetic fields|J.G. Chigvinadze, J.V. Acrivos, S.M. Ashimov, A.A. Iashvili, T. V.   Machaidze, Th. Wolf|It is used the mechanical method of Abrikosov vortex stimulated dynamics investigation in superconductors. With its help it was studied relaxation phenomena in vortex matter of high-temperature superconductors. It established that pulsed magnetic fields change the course of relaxation processes taking place in vortex matter. The study of the influence of magnetic pulses differing by their durations and amplitudes on vortex system of isotropic high-temperature superconductors system HoBa2Cu3O7-d showed the presence of threshold phenomena. The small duration pulses does not change the course of relaxation processes taking place in vortex matter. When the duration of pulses exceeds some critical value (threshold), then their influence change the course of relaxation process which is revealed by stepwise change of relaxing mechanical moment . These investigations showed that the time for formatting of Abrikosov vortex lattice in HoBa2Cu3O7-d is of the order of 20 microsec. which on the order of value exceeds the time necessary for formation of a single vortex observed in type II superconductors.
352|Spin and pseudospin symmetries and the equivalent spectra of   relativistic spin-1/2 and spin-0 particles|P. Alberto, A. S. de Castro, M. Malheiro|We show that the conditions which originate the spin and pseudospin symmetries in the Dirac equation are the same that produce equivalent energy spectra of relativistic spin-1/2 and spin-0 particles in the presence of vector and scalar potentials. The conclusions do not depend on the particular shapes of the potentials and can be important in different fields of physics. When both scalar and vector potentials are spherical, these conditions for isospectrality imply that the spin-orbit and Darwin terms of either the upper component or the lower component of the Dirac spinor vanish, making it equivalent, as far as energy is concerned, to a spin-0 state. In this case, besides energy, a scalar particle will also have the same orbital angular momentum as the (conserved) orbital angular momentum of either the upper or lower component of the corresponding spin-1/2 particle. We point out a few possible applications of this result.
353|General asymptotic solutions of the Einstein equations and phase   transitions in quantum gravity|D. Podolsky|We discuss generic properties of classical and quantum theories of gravity with a scalar field which are revealed at the vicinity of the cosmological singularity. When the potential of the scalar field is exponential and unbounded from below, the general solution of the Einstein equations has quasi-isotropic asymptotics near the singularity instead of the usual anisotropic Belinskii - Khalatnikov - Lifshitz (BKL) asymptotics. Depending on the strength of scalar field potential, there exist two phases of quantum gravity with scalar field: one with essentially anisotropic behavior of field correlation functions near the cosmological singularity, and another with quasi-isotropic behavior. The ``phase transition'' between the two phases is interpreted as the condensation of gravitons.
354|Trigonometric parallaxes of high velocity halo white dwarf candidates|C. Ducourant, R. Teixeira, N.C. Hambly, B. R. Oppenheimer, M.R.S.   Hawkins, M. Rapaport, J. Modolo, J.F. Lecampion|The status of 38 halo white dwarf candidates identified by Oppenheimer et al. (2001) has been intensively discussed by various authors. In analyses undertaken to date, trigonometric parallaxes are crucial missing data. Distance measurements are mandatory to kinematically segregate halo object from disk objects and hence enable a more reliable estimate of the local density of halo dark matter residing in such objects.   We present trigonometric parallax measurements for 15 candidate halo white dwarfs (WDs) selected from the Oppenheimer et al. (2001) list. We observed the stars using the ESO 1.56-m Danish Telescope and ESO 2.2-m telescope from August 2001 to July 2004. Parallaxes with accuracies of 1--2 mas were determined yielding relative errors on distances of $\sim5$% for 6 objects, $\sim12$% for 3 objects, and $\sim20$% for two more objects. Four stars appear to be too distant (probably farther than 100 pc) to have measurable parallaxes in our observations. Distances, absolute magnitudes and revised space velocities were derived for the 15 halo WDs from the Oppenheimer et al. (2001) list. Halo membership is confirmed unambiguously for 6 objects while 5 objects may be thick disk members and 4 objects are too distant to draw any conclusion based solely on kinematics. Comparing our trigonometric parallaxes with photometric parallaxes used in previous work reveals an overestimation of distance as derived from photometric techniques. This new data set can be used to revise the halo white dwarf space density, and that analysis will be presented in a subsequent publication.
355|AMR simulations of the low T/W bar-mode instability of neutron stars|Pablo Cerd\'a-Dur\'an, Vicent Quilis, Jos\'e A. Font|It has been recently argued through numerical work that rotating stars with a high degree of differential rotation are dynamically unstable against bar-mode deformation, even for values of the ratio of rotational kinetic energy to gravitational potential energy as low as O(0.01). This may have implications for gravitational wave astronomy in high-frequency sources such as core collapse supernovae. In this paper we present high-resolution simulations, performed with an adaptive mesh refinement hydrodynamics code, of such low T/W bar-mode instability. The complex morphological features involved in the nonlinear dynamics of the instability are revealed in our simulations, which show that the excitation of Kelvin-Helmholtz-like fluid modes outside the corotation radius of the star leads to the saturation of the bar-mode deformation. While the overall trends reported in an earlier investigation are confirmed by our work, we also find that numerical resolution plays an important role during the long-term, nonlinear behaviour of the instability, which has implications on the dynamics of rotating stars and on the attainable amplitudes of the associated gravitational wave signals.
356|Evolutionary games on minimally structured populations|Gergely J Szollosi and Imre Derenyi|Population structure induced by both spatial embedding and more general networks of interaction, such as model social networks, have been shown to have a fundamental effect on the dynamics and outcome of evolutionary games. These effects have, however, proved to be sensitive to the details of the underlying topology and dynamics. Here we introduce a minimal population structure that is described by two distinct hierarchical levels of interaction. We believe this model is able to identify effects of spatial structure that do not depend on the details of the topology. We derive the dynamics governing the evolution of a system starting from fundamental individual level stochastic processes through two successive meanfield approximations. In our model of population structure the topology of interactions is described by only two parameters: the effective population size at the local scale and the relative strength of local dynamics to global mixing. We demonstrate, for example, the existence of a continuous transition leading to the dominance of cooperation in populations with hierarchical levels of unstructured mixing as the benefit to cost ratio becomes smaller then the local population size. Applying our model of spatial structure to the repeated prisoner's dilemma we uncover a novel and counterintuitive mechanism by which the constant influx of defectors sustains cooperation. Further exploring the phase space of the repeated prisoner's dilemma and also of the "rock-paper-scissor" game we find indications of rich structure and are able to reproduce several effects observed in other models with explicit spatial embedding, such as the maintenance of biodiversity and the emergence of global oscillations.
357|Flavor Physics in SUSY at large tan(beta)|Paride Paradisi|We discuss the phenomenological impact of a particularly interesting corner of the MSSM: the large tan(beta) regime. The capabilities of leptonic and hadronic Flavor Violating processes in shedding light on physics beyond the Standard Model are reviewed. Moreover, we show that tests of Lepton Universality in charged current processes can represent an interesting handle to obtain relevant information on New Physics scenarios.
358|Some properties of the complex Monge-Ampere operator in Cegrell's   classes and applications|Nguyen Van Khue and Pham Hoang Hiep|In this article we will first prove a result about convergence in capacity. Using the achieved result we will obtain a general decompositon theorem for complex Monge-Ampere measues which will be used to prove a comparison principle for the complex Monge-Ampere operator.
359|Torsional oscillations of longitudinally inhomogeneous coronal loops|T.V. Zaqarashvili and K Murawski|We explore the effect of an inhomogeneous mass density field on frequencies and wave profiles of torsional Alfven oscillations in solar coronal loops. Dispersion relations for torsional oscillations are derived analytically in limits of weak and strong inhomogeneities. These analytical results are verified by numerical solutions, which are valid for a wide range of inhomogeneity strength. It is shown that the inhomogeneous mass density field leads to the reduction of a wave frequency of torsional oscillations, in comparison to that of estimated from mass density at the loop apex. This frequency reduction results from the decrease of an average Alfven speed as far as the inhomogeneous loop is denser at its footpoints. The derived dispersion relations and wave profiles are important for potential observations of torsional oscillations which result in periodic variations of spectral line widths. Torsional oscillations offer an additional powerful tool for a development of coronal seismology.
360|Pseudo-random Puncturing: A Technique to Lower the Error Floor of Turbo   Codes|Ioannis Chatzigeorgiou, Miguel R. D. Rodrigues, Ian J. Wassell and   Rolando Carrasco|It has been observed that particular rate-1/2 partially systematic parallel concatenated convolutional codes (PCCCs) can achieve a lower error floor than that of their rate-1/3 parent codes. Nevertheless, good puncturing patterns can only be identified by means of an exhaustive search, whilst convergence towards low bit error probabilities can be problematic when the systematic output of a rate-1/2 partially systematic PCCC is heavily punctured. In this paper, we present and study a family of rate-1/2 partially systematic PCCCs, which we call pseudo-randomly punctured codes. We evaluate their bit error rate performance and we show that they always yield a lower error floor than that of their rate-1/3 parent codes. Furthermore, we compare analytic results to simulations and we demonstrate that their performance converges towards the error floor region, owning to the moderate puncturing of their systematic output. Consequently, we propose pseudo-random puncturing as a means of improving the bandwidth efficiency of a PCCC and simultaneously lowering its error floor.
361|The Arctic Circle Revisited|F. Colomo and A.G. Pronko|The problem of limit shapes in the six-vertex model with domain wall boundary conditions is addressed by considering a specially tailored bulk correlation function, the emptiness formation probability. A closed expression of this correlation function is given, both in terms of certain determinant and multiple integral, which allows for a systematic treatment of the limit shapes of the model for full range of values of vertex weights. Specifically, we show that for vertex weights corresponding to the free-fermion line on the phase diagram, the emptiness formation probability is related to a one-matrix model with a triple logarithmic singularity, or Triple Penner model. The saddle-point analysis of this model leads to the Arctic Circle Theorem, and its generalization to the Arctic Ellipses, known previously from domino tilings.
362|Time and motion in physics: the Reciprocity Principle, relativistic   invariance of the lengths of rulers and time dilatation|J.H.Field|Ponderable objects moving in free space according to Newton's First Law constitute both rulers and clocks when one such object is viewed from the rest frame of another. Together with the Reciprocity Principle this is used to demonstrate, in both Galilean and special relativity, the invariance of the measured length of a ruler in motion. The different times: `proper', `improper' and `apparent' appearing in different formulations of the relativistic time dilatation relation are discussed and exemplified by experimental applications. A non-intuitive `length expansion' effect predicted by the Reciprocity Principle as a necessary consequence of time dilatation is pointed out
363|B --> rho K* decays and other rare vector-vector modes|G. Vasseur|The recent analyses of the following rare vector-vector decays of the B meson are presented: rho K*, omega K*, omega rho, omega omega, and omega phi charmless final states. The latest results indicate that the fraction of longitudinal polarization is about 0.5 in penguin-dominated modes and close to 1 for tree-dominated modes.
364|Extending the theory of phonon-mediated superconductivity in quasi-2D|J.P.Hague|I present results from an extended Migdal-Eliashberg theory of electron-phonon interactions and superconductivity. The history of the electron-phonon problem is introduced, and then study of the intermediate parameter regime is justified from the energy scales in the cuprate superconductors. The Holstein model is detailed, and limiting cases are examined to demonstrate the need for an extended theory of superconductivity. Results of the extended approximation are shown, including spectral functions and phase diagrams. These are discussed with reference to Hohenberg's theorem, the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer theory and Coulomb repulsion.
365|Generalized Nariai Solutions for Yang-type Monopoles|Pablo Diaz, Antonio Segui|A detailed study of the geometries that emerge by a gravitating generalized Yang monopole in even dimensions is carried out. In particular, those which present black hole and cosmological horizons. This two-horizon system is thermally unstable. The process of thermalization will drive both horizons to coalesce. This limit is what is profusely studied in this paper. It is shown that eventhough coordinate distance shrinks to zero, physical distance does not. So, there is some remaining space which geometry has been computed and identified as a generalized Nariai solution. The thermal properties of this new spacetime are then calculated. Topics, as the elliptical relation between radii of spheres in the geometry or a discussion about whether a mass-type term should be present in the line element or not, are also included.
366|Instanton representation of Plebanski gravity. Consistency of the   initital value constraints under time evolution|Eyo Eyo Ita III|The instanton representation of Plebanski gravity provides as equations of motion a Hodge self-duality condition and a set of `generalized' Maxwell's equations, subject to gravitational degrees of freedom encoded in the initial value constraints of general relativity. The main result of the present paper will be to prove that this constraint surface is preserved under time evolution. We carry this out not using the usual Dirac procedure, but rather the Lagrangian equations of motion themsleves. Finally, we provide a comparison with the Ashtekar formulation to place these results into overall context.
367|Metal-insulator transition in the low-dimensional organic conductor   (TMTSF)2FSO3 probed by infrared microspectroscopy|A. Pashkin, K. Thirunavukkuarasu, Y.-L. Mathis, W. Kang, and C. A.   Kuntscher|We present measurements of the infrared response of the quasi-one-dimensional organic conductor (TMTSF)2$SO3 along (Ea) and perpendicular (Eb') to the stacking axis as a function of temperature. Above the metal-insulator transition related to the anion ordering the optical conductivity spectra show a Drude-like response. Below the transition an energy gap of about 1500 cm-1 (185 meV) opens, leading to the corresponding charge transfer band in the optical conductivity spectra. The analysis of the infrared-active vibrations gives evidence for the long-range crystal structure modulation below the transition temperature and for the short-range order fluctuations of the lattice modulation above the transition temperature. Also we report about a new infrared mode at around 710 cm-1 with a peculiar temperature behavior, which has so far not been observed in any other (TMTSF)2X salt showing a metal-insulator transition. A qualitative model based on the coupling between the TMTSF molecule vibration and the reorientation of electrical dipole moment of the FSO3 anion is proposed, in order to explain the anomalous behavior of the new mode.
368|The effect of Topcolor Assisted Technicolor, and other models, on   Neutrino Oscillation|Minako Honda, Yee Kao, Naotoshi Okamura, Alexey Pronin, and Tatsu   Takeuchi|New physics beyond the Standard Model can lead to extra matter effects on neutrino oscillation if the new interactions distinguish among the three flavors of neutrino. In Ref.1, we argued that a long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiment in which the Fermilab-NUMI beam in its high-energy mode is aimed at the planned Hyper-Kamiokande detector would be capable of constraining the size of those extra matter effects, provided the vacuum value of \sin^2 2\theta_{23} is not too close to one. In this talk, we discuss how such a constraint would translate into limits on the coupling constants and masses of new particles in models such as topcolor assisted technicolor.
369|Shaped angular dependence of the spin transfer torque and microwave   generation without magnetic field|O. Boulle, V. Cros, J. Grollier, L. G. Pereira, C. Deranlot, F.   Petroff, G. Faini, J. Barnas, A. Fert|The generation of oscillations in the microwave frequency range is one of the most important applications expected from spintronics devices exploiting the spin transfer phenomenon. We report transport and microwave power measurements on specially designed nanopillars for which a non-standard angular dependence of the spin transfer torque (wavy variation) is predicted by theoretical models. We observe a new kind of current-induced dynamics that is characterized by large angle precessions in the absence of any applied field, as this is also predicted by simulation with such a wavy angular dependence of the torque. This type of non-standard nanopillars can represent an interesting way for the implementation of spin transfer oscillators since they are able to generate microwave oscillations without applied magnetic field. We also emphasize the theoretical implications of our results on the angular dependence of the torque.
370|Dark energy interacting with neutrinos and dark matter: a   phenomenological theory|G. M. Kremer|A model for a flat homogeneous and isotropic Universe composed of dark energy, dark matter, neutrinos, radiation and baryons is analyzed. The fields of dark matter and neutrinos are supposed to interact with the dark energy. The dark energy is considered to obey either the van der Waals or the Chaplygin equations of state. The ratio between the pressure and the energy density of the neutrinos varies with the red-shift simulating massive and non-relativistic neutrinos at small red-shifts and non-massive relativistic neutrinos at high red-shifts. The model can reproduce the expected red-shift behaviors of the deceleration parameter and of the density parameters of each constituent.
371|Levy-Lieb constrained-search formulation as a minimization of the   correlation functional|L.Delle Site|The constrained-search formulation of Levy and Lieb, which formally defines the exact Hohenberg-Kohn functional for any N-representable electron density, is here shown to be equivalent to the minimization of the correlation functional with respect to the N-1 conditional probability density, where N is number of electrons of the system. The consequences and implications of such a result are here analyzed and discussed via a practical example.
372|Reality of linear and angular momentum expectation values in bound   states|Utpal Roy, Suranjana Ghosh, T. Shreecharan, and Kaushik Bhattacharya|In quantum mechanics textbooks the momentum operator is defined in the Cartesian coordinates and rarely the form of the momentum operator in spherical polar coordinates is discussed. Consequently one always generalizes the Cartesian prescription to other coordinates and falls in a trap. In this work we introduce the difficulties one faces when the question of the momentum operator in spherical polar coordinate comes. We have tried to point out most of the elementary quantum mechanical results, related to the momentum operator, which has coordinate dependence. We explicitly calculate the momentum expectation values in various bound states and show that the expectation value really turns out to be zero, a consequence of the fact that the momentum expectation value is real. We comment briefly on the status of the angular variables in quantum mechanics and the problems related in interpreting them as dynamical variables. At the end, we calculate the Heisenberg's equation of motion for the radial component of the momentum for the Hydrogen atom.

374|Rich methane premixed laminar flames doped by light unsaturated   hydrocarbons - Part I : allene and propyne|Hadj-Ali Gueniche (DCPR), Pierre-Alexandre Glaude (DCPR), Guillaume   Dayma (DCPR), Ren\'e Fournet (DCPR), Fr\'ed\'erique Battin-Leclerc (DCPR)|The structure of three laminar premixed rich flames has been investigated: a pure methane flame and two methane flames doped by allene and propyne, respectively. The gases of the three flames contain 20.9% (molar) of methane and 33.4% of oxygen, corresponding to an equivalence ratio of 1.25 for the pure methane flame. In both doped flames, 2.49% of C3H4 was added, corresponding to a ratio C3H4/CH4 of 12% and an equivalence ratio of 1.55. The three flames have been stabilized on a burner at a pressure of 6.7 kPa using argon as dilutant, with a gas velocity at the burner of 36 cm/s at 333 K. The concentration profiles of stable species were measured by gas chromatography after sampling with a quartz microprobe. Quantified species included carbon monoxide and dioxide, methane, oxygen, hydrogen, ethane, ethylene, acetylene, propyne, allene, propene, propane, 1,2-butadiene, 1,3-butadiene, 1-butene, isobutene, 1-butyne, vinylacetylene, and benzene. The temperature was measured using a PtRh (6%)-PtRh (30%) thermocouple settled inside the enclosure and ranged from 700 K close to the burner up to 1850 K. In order to model these new results, some improvements have been made to a mechanism previously developed in our laboratory for the reactions of C3-C4 unsaturated hydrocarbons. The main reaction pathways of consumption of allene and propyne and of formation of C6 aromatic species have been derived from flow rate analyses.
375|Environmental noise reduction for holonomic quantum gates|Daniele Parodi, Maura Sassetti, Paolo Solinas, Nino Zangh\`i|We study the performance of holonomic quantum gates, driven by lasers, under the effect of a dissipative environment modeled as a thermal bath of oscillators. We show how to enhance the performance of the gates by suitable choice of the loop in the manifold of the controllable parameters of the laser. For a simplified, albeit realistic model, we find the surprising result that for a long time evolution the performance of the gate (properly estimated in terms of average fidelity) increases. On the basis of this result, we compare holonomic gates with the so-called stimulated Raman adiabatic passage (STIRAP) gates.
376|The lifetime of unstable particles in electromagnetic fields|Daniele Binosi (ECT*, Trento), Vladimir Pascalutsa (ECT*, Trento &   Mainz U.)|We show that the electromagnetic moments of unstable particles (resonances) have an absorptive contribution which quantifies the change of the particle's lifetime in an external electromagnetic field. To give an example we compute here the imaginary part of the magnetic moment for the cases of the muon and the neutron at leading order in the electroweak coupling. We also consider an analogous effect for the strongly-decaying $\Delta$(1232) resonance. The result for the muon is Im$ \mu = e G_F^2 m^3/768 \pi^3$, with $e$ the charge and $m$ the mass of the muon, $G_F$ the Fermi constant, which in an external magnetic field of $B$ Tesla give rise to the relative change in the muon lifetime of $3\times 10^{-15} B$. For neutron the effect is of a similar magnitude. We speculate on the observable implications of this effect.
377|An equilibrium problem for the limiting eigenvalue distribution of   banded Toeplitz matrices|Maurice Duits and Arno B.J. Kuijlaars|We study the limiting eigenvalue distribution of $n\times n$ banded Toeplitz matrices as $n\to \infty$. From classical results of Schmidt-Spitzer and Hirschman it is known that the eigenvalues accumulate on a special curve in the complex plane and the normalized eigenvalue counting measure converges weakly to a measure on this curve as $n\to\infty$. In this paper, we characterize the limiting measure in terms of an equilibrium problem. The limiting measure is one component of the unique vector of measures that minimes an energy functional defined on admissible vectors of measures. In addition, we show that each of the other components is the limiting measure of the normalized counting measure on certain generalized eigenvalues.
378|Exponential growth rates in a typed branching diffusion|Y. Git, J. W. Harris, S. C. Harris|We study the high temperature phase of a family of typed branching diffusions initially studied in [Ast\'{e}risque 236 (1996) 133--154] and [Lecture Notes in Math. 1729 (2000) 239--256 Springer, Berlin]. The primary aim is to establish some almost-sure limit results for the long-term behavior of this particle system, namely the speed at which the population of particles colonizes both space and type dimensions, as well as the rate at which the population grows within this asymptotic shape. Our approach will include identification of an explicit two-phase mechanism by which particles can build up in sufficient numbers with spatial positions near $-\gamma t$ and type positions near $\kappa \sqrt{t}$ at large times $t$. The proofs involve the application of a variety of martingale techniques--most importantly a ``spine'' construction involving a change of measure with an additive martingale. In addition to the model's intrinsic interest, the methodologies presented contain ideas that will adapt to other branching settings. We also briefly discuss applications to traveling wave solutions of an associated reaction--diffusion equation.
379|The collision velocity of the bullet cluster in conventional and   modified dynamics|Garry W. Angus (St. Andrews), Stacy S. McGaugh (Maryland)|We consider the orbit of the bullet cluster 1E 0657-56 in both CDM and MOND using accurate mass models appropriate to each case in order to ascertain the maximum plausible collision velocity. Impact velocities consistent with the shock velocity (~ 4700km/s) occur naturally in MOND. CDM can generate collision velocities of at most ~ 3800km/s, and is only consistent with the data provided that the shock velocity has been substantially enhanced by hydrodynamical effects.
380|On Some Subgroup Chains Related to Kneser's Theorem|Yahya Ould Hamidoune, Oriol Serra, Gilles Zemor|A recent result of Balandraud shows that for every subset S of an abelian group G, there exists a non trivial subgroup H such that TS <= T+S-2 holds only if the stabilizer of TS contains H. Notice that Kneser's Theorem says only that the stabilizer of TS must be a non-zero subgroup.   This strong form of Kneser's theorem follows from some nice properties of a certain poset investigated by Balandraud. We consider an analogous poset for nonabelian groups and, by using classical tools from Additive Number Theory, extend some of the above results. In particular we obtain short proofs of Balandraud's results in the abelian case.
381|The Exact Boundary Condition to Solve the Schrodinger Equation of Many   Electron System|Rajendra Prasad|In an attempt to bypass the sign problem in quantum Monte Carlo simulation of electronic systems within the framework of fixed node approach, we derive the exclusion principle "Two electrons can't be at the same external isopotential surface simultaneously" using the first postulate of quantum mechanics. We propose the exact Coulomb-Exchange nodal surface i.e. the exact boundary condition to solve the non-relativistic Schrodinger equation for the non-degenerate ground state of atoms and molecules. This boundary condition was applied to compute the ground state energies of N, Ne, Li2, Be2, B2, C2, N2, O2, F2, and H2O systems using diffusion Monte Carlo method. The ground state energies thus obtained agree well with the exact estimate of non-relativistic energies.
382|Clustering features of $^9$Be, $^{14}$N, $^7$Be, and $^8$B nuclei in   relativistic fragmentation|D. A. Artemenkov, T. V. Shchedrina, R. Stanoeva, and P. I. Zarubin|Recent studies of clustering in light nuclei with an initial energy above 1 A GeV in nuclear treack emulsion are overviewed. The results of investigations of the relativistic $^9$Be nuclei fragmentation in emulsion, which entails the production of He fragments, are presented. It is shown that most precise angular measurements provided by this technique play a crucial role in the restoration of the excitation spectrum of the $\alpha$ particle sysytem. In peripheral interactions $^9$Be nuclei are dissociated practically totally through the 0$^+$ and 2$^+$ states of the $^8$Be nucleus.   The results of investigations of the dissociation of a $^{14}$N nucleus of momentum 2.86 A GeV/c in emulsion are presented as example of more complicated system. The momentum and correlation characteristics of $\alpha$ particles for the $^{14}$N$\to3\alpha+X$ channel in the laboratory system and the rest systems of 3$\alpha$ particles were considered in detail.   Topology of charged fragments produced in peripheral relativistic dissociation of radioactive $^8$B, $^7$Be nuclei in emulsion is studied.
383|Super-shell structures and pairing in ultracold trapped Fermi gases|M. Ogren and H. Heiselberg|We calculate level densities and pairing gaps for an ultracold dilute gas of fermionic atoms in harmonic traps under the influence of mean field and anharmonic quartic trap potentials. Super-shell structures, which were found in Hartree-Fock calculations, are calculated analytically within periodic orbit theory as well as from WKB calculations. For attractive interactions, the underlying level densities are crucial for pairing and super-shell structures in gaps are predicted.
384|Quantum non-local effects with Bose-Einstein condensates|Franck Lalo\"e (LKB - Lhomond), William J. Mullin (UMASS)|We study theoretically the properties of two Bose-Einstein condensates in different spin states, represented by a double Fock state. Individual measurements of the spins of the particles are performed in transverse directions, giving access to the relative phase of the condensates. Initially, this phase is completely undefined, and the first measurements provide random results. But a fixed value of this phase rapidly emerges under the effect of the successive quantum measurements, giving rise to a quasi-classical situation where all spins have parallel transverse orientations. If the number of measurements reaches its maximum (the number of particles), quantum effects show up again, giving rise to violations of Bell type inequalities. The violation of BCHSH inequalities with an arbitrarily large number of spins may be comparable (or even equal) to that obtained with two spins.
385|Low mass visual binaries in the solar neighbourhood: The case of   HD141272|T. Eisenbeiss, A. Seifahrt, M. Mugrauer, T.O.B. Schmidt, R.   Neuhaeuser, T. Roell|We search for stellar and substellar companions of young nearby stars to investigate stellar multiplicity and formation of stellar and substellar companions. We detect common proper-motion companions of stars via multi-epoch imaging. Their companionship is finally confirmed with photometry and spectroscopy. Here we report the discovery of a new co-moving (13 sigma) stellar companion ~17.8 arcsec (350 AU in projected separation) north of the nearby star HD141272 (21 pc). With EMMI/NTT optical spectroscopy we determined the spectral type of the companion to be M3+-0.5V. The derived spectral type as well as the near infrared photometry of the companion are both fully consistent with a 0.26+-0.07 Msol dwarf located at the distance of HD141272 (21 pc). Furthermore the photometry data rules out the pre-main sequence status, since the system is consistent with the ZAMS of the Pleiades.
386|Sterile neutrinos at the CNGS|A. Donini, M. Maltoni, D. Meloni, P. Migliozzi, F. Terranova|We study the potential of the CNGS beam in constraining the parameter space of a model with one sterile neutrino separated from three active ones by an $\mathcal{O}(\eVq)$ mass-squared difference, $\Dmq_\Sbl$. We perform our analysis using the OPERA detector as a reference (our analysis can be upgraded including a detailed simulation of the ICARUS detector). We point out that the channel with the largest potential to constrain the sterile neutrino parameter space at the CNGS beam is $\nu_\mu \to \nu_\tau$. The reason for that is twofold: first, the active-sterile mixing angle that governs this oscillation is the less constrained by present experiments; second, this is the signal for which both OPERA and ICARUS have been designed, and thus benefits from an extremely low background. In our analysis we also took into account $\nu_\mu \to \nu_e$ oscillations. We find that the CNGS potential to look for sterile neutrinos is limited with nominal intensity of the beam, but it is significantly enhanced with a factor 2 to 10 increase in the neutrino flux. Data from both channels allow us, in this case, to constrain further the four-neutrino model parameter space. Our results hold for any value of $\Dmq_\Sbl \gtrsim 0.1 \eVq$, \textit{i.e.} when oscillations driven by this mass-squared difference are averaged. We have also checked that the bound on $\theta_{13}$ that can be put at the CNGS is not affected by the possible existence of sterile neutrinos.
387|Evolution of the Carter constant for inspirals into a black hole: effect   of the black hole quadrupole|Eanna E. Flanagan and Tanja Hinderer|We analyze the effect of gravitational radiation reaction on generic orbits around a body with an axisymmetric mass quadrupole moment Q to linear order in Q, to the leading post-Newtonian order, and to linear order in the mass ratio. This system admits three constants of the motion in absence of radiation reaction: energy, angular momentum, and a third constant analogous to the Carter constant. We compute instantaneous and time-averaged rates of change of these three constants. For a point particle orbiting a black hole, Ryan has computed the leading order evolution of the orbit's Carter constant, which is linear in the spin. Our result, when combined with an interaction quadratic in the spin (the coupling of the black hole's spin to its own radiation reaction field), gives the next to leading order evolution. The effect of the quadrupole, like that of the linear spin term, is to circularize eccentric orbits and to drive the orbital plane towards antialignment with the symmetry axis. In addition we consider a system of two point masses where one body has a single mass multipole or current multipole. To linear order in the mass ratio, to linear order in the multipole, and to the leading post-Newtonian order, we show that there does not exist an analog of the Carter constant for such a system (except for the cases of spin and mass quadrupole). With mild additional assumptions, this result falsifies the conjecture that all vacuum, axisymmetric spacetimes posess a third constant of geodesic motion.
388|Dual billiards, Fagnano orbits and regular polygons|Serge Troubetzkoy (CPT, Iml, Frumam)|We study the notion of Fagnano orbits for dual polygonal billiards. We used them to characterize regular polygons and we study the iteration of the developing map.
389|Exactly solvable spin dynamics of an electron coupled to large number of   nuclei and the electron-nuclear spin echo in a quantum dot|G. G. Kozlov|The model considered in the paper is used nowadays to describe spin dynamics of quantum dots after optical excitation. Based on the exact diagonalization of a model Hamiltonian, we solve the problems of the electron spin polarization decay and magnetic field dependence of the steady state polarization. The important role of the nuclear state is shown and methods of its calculation for different regimes of optical excitation are proposed. The effect of spin echo observed after application of the magnetic field $\pi$-pulse is predicted.
390|Simulation of Robustness against Lesions of Cortical Networks|Marcus Kaiser, Robert Martin, Peter Andras and Malcolm P. Young|Structure entails function and thus a structural description of the brain will help to understand its function and may provide insights into many properties of brain systems, from their robustness and recovery from damage, to their dynamics and even their evolution. Advances in the analysis of complex networks provide useful new approaches to understanding structural and functional properties of brain networks. Structural properties of networks recently described allow their characterization as small-world, random (exponential) and scale-free. They complement the set of other properties that have been explored in the context of brain connectivity, such as topology, hodology, clustering, and hierarchical organization. Here we apply new network analysis methods to cortical inter-areal connectivity networks for the cat and macaque brains. We compare these corticocortical fibre networks to benchmark rewired, small-world, scale-free and random networks, using two analysis strategies, in which we measure the effects of the removal of nodes and connections on the structural properties of the cortical networks. The brain networks' structural decay is in most respects similar to that of scale-free networks. The results implicate highly connected hub-nodes and bottleneck connections as structural basis for some of the conditional robustness of brain systems. This informs the understanding of the development of brain networks' connectivity.
391|A thermodynamic model for the melting of supported metal nanoparticles|S. C. Hendy|We construct a simple thermodynamic model to describe the melting of a supported metal nanoparticle with a spherically curved free surface both with and without surface melting. We use the model to investigate the results of recent molecular dynamics simulations, which suggest the melting temperature of a supported metal particle is the same as that of a free spherical particle with the same surface curvature. Our model shows that this is only the case when the contact angles of the supported solid and liquid particles are similar. This is also the case for the temperature at which surface melting begins.
392|Average optimality for risk-sensitive control with general state space|Anna Ja\'skiewicz|This paper deals with discrete-time Markov control processes on a general state space. A long-run risk-sensitive average cost criterion is used as a performance measure. The one-step cost function is nonnegative and possibly unbounded. Using the vanishing discount factor approach, the optimality inequality and an optimal stationary strategy for the decision maker are established.
393|A Study of $B_{d}^0 \to J/\Psi \eta^{(\prime)}$ Decays in the pQCD   Approach|Xin Liu, Zhen-Jun Xiao, and Hui-Sheng Wang|Motivated by the very recent measurement of the branching ratio of ${B_d^0} \to J/\psi \eta$ decay, we calculate the branching ratios of ${B_d}^0 \to J/\psi \eta$ and ${B_d}^0 \to J/\Psi \eta'$ decays in the perturbative QCD (pQCD) approach. The pQCD predictions for the branching ratios of considered decays are: $BR(B_d^0 \to J/\Psi \eta) = (1.96 ^{+9.68}_{-0.65}) \times 10^{-6}$, which is consistent with the first experimental measurement within errors; while $BR(B_d^0 \to J/\Psi \eta') = (1.09 ^{+3.76}_{-0.25}) \times 10^{-6}$, very similar with $B_d^0 \to \jpsi \eta$ decay and can be tested by the forthcoming LHC experiments. The measurements of these decay channels may help us to understand the QCD dynamics in the corresponding energy scale, especially the reliability of pQCD approach to these kinds of B meson decays.
394|Finite-temperature phase transitions in a two-dimensional boson Hubbard   model|Min-Chul Cha and Ji-Woo Lee|We study finite-temperature phase transitions in a two-dimensional boson Hubbard model with zero-point quantum fluctuations via Monte Carlo simulations of quantum rotor model, and construct the corresponding phase diagram. Compressibility shows a thermally activated gapped behavior in the insulating regime. Finite-size scaling of the superfluid stiffness clearly shows the nature of the Kosterlitz-Thouless transition. The transition temperature, $T_c$, confirms a scaling relation $T_c \propto \rho_0^x$ with $x=1.0$. Some evidences of anomalous quantum behavior at low temperatures are presented.
395|Conditional generation of path-entangled optical NOON states|Anne E. B. Nielsen and Klaus Molmer|We propose a measurement protocol to generate path-entangled NOON states conditionally from two pulsed type II optical parametric oscillators. We calculate the fidelity of the produced states and the success probability of the protocol. The trigger detectors are assumed to have finite dead time, and for short pulse trigger fields they are modeled as on/off detectors with finite efficiency. Continuous-wave operation of the parametric oscillators is also considered.
396|Renewals for exponentially increasing lifetimes, with an application to   digital search trees|Florian Dennert, Rudolf Gr\"ubel|We show that the number of renewals up to time $t$ exhibits distributional fluctuations as $t\to\infty$ if the underlying lifetimes increase at an exponential rate in a distributional sense. This provides a probabilistic explanation for the asymptotics of insertion depth in random trees generated by a bit-comparison strategy from uniform input; we also obtain a representation for the resulting family of limit laws along subsequences. Our approach can also be used to obtain rates of convergence.
397|Hawking radiation of linear dilaton black holes|G. Clement, J.C. Fabris and G.T. Marques|We compute exactly the semi-classical radiation spectrum for a class of non-asymptotically flat charged dilaton black holes, the so-called linear dilaton black holes. In the high frequency regime, the temperature for these black holes generically agrees with the surface gravity result. In the special case where the black hole is massless, we show that, although the surface gravity remains finite, there is no radiation, in agreement with the fact that massless objects cannot radiate.
398|The S-Matrix of AdS/CFT and Yangian Symmetry|Niklas Beisert|We review the algebraic construction of the S-matrix of AdS/CFT. We also present its symmetry algebra which turns out to be a Yangian of the centrally extended su(22) superalgebra.
399|Modelling the Near-IR Spectra of Red Supergiant-dominated Populations|A. Lan\c{c}on, J.S. Gallagher, R. de Grijs, P. Hauschildt, D. Ladjal,   M. Mouhcine, L.J. Smith, P.R. Wood, N. F\"orster Schreiber|We report on recent progress in the modelling of the near-IR spectra of young stellar populations, i.e. populations in which red supergiants (RSGs) are dominant. First, we discuss the determination of fundamental parameters of RSGs using fits to their near-IR spectra with new PHOENIX model spectra; RSG-specific surface abundances are accounted for and effects of the microturbulence parameter are explored. New population synthesis predictions are then described and, as an example, it is shown that the spectra of young star clusters in M82 can be reproduced very well from 0.5 to 2.4 micrometers. We warn of remaining uncertainties in cluster ages.
400|Locating the peaks of least-energy solutions to a quasilinear elliptic   Neumann problem|Yi Li and Chunshan Zhao|In this paper we study the shape of least-energy solutions to a singularly perturbed quasilinear problem with homogeneous Neumann boundary condition. We use an intrinsic variation method to show that at limit, the global maximum point of least-energy solutions goes to a point on the boundary faster than the linear rate and this point on the boundary approaches to a point where the mean curvature of the boundary achieves its maximum. We also give a complete proof of exponential decay of least-energy solutions.
401|Review: Semiconductor Quantum Light Sources|Andrew J Shields|Lasers and LEDs display a statistical distribution in the number of photons emitted in a given time interval. New applications exploiting the quantum properties of light require sources for which either individual photons, or pairs, are generated in a regulated stream. Here we review recent research on single-photon sources based on the emission of a single semiconductor quantum dot. In just a few years remarkable progress has been made in generating indistinguishable single-photons and entangled photon pairs using such structures. It suggests it may be possible to realise compact, robust, LED-like semiconductor devices for quantum light generation.
402|To the origin of the difference of FSI phases in $B\to\pi\pi$ and   $B\to\rho\rho$ decays|A.B.Kaidalov, M.I.Vysotsky|The final state interactions (FSI) model in which soft rescattering of low mass intermediate states dominates is suggested. It explains why the strong interaction phases are large in the $B_d\to\pi\pi$ channel and are considerably smaller in the $B_d\to\rho\rho$ one. Direct CP asymmetries of $B_d\to\pi\pi$ decays which are determined by FSI phases are considered as well.
403|An invariance principle for semimartingale reflecting Brownian motions   in domains with piecewise smooth boundaries|W. Kang, R. J. Williams|Semimartingale reflecting Brownian motions (SRBMs) living in the closures of domains with piecewise smooth boundaries are of interest in applied probability because of their role as heavy traffic approximations for some stochastic networks. In this paper, assuming certain conditions on the domains and directions of reflection, a perturbation result, or invariance principle, for SRBMs is proved. This provides sufficient conditions for a process that satisfies the definition of an SRBM, except for small random perturbations in the defining conditions, to be close in distribution to an SRBM. A crucial ingredient in the proof of this result is an oscillation inequality for solutions of a perturbed Skorokhod problem. We use the invariance principle to show weak existence of SRBMs under mild conditions. We also use the invariance principle, in conjunction with known uniqueness results for SRBMs, to give some sufficient conditions for validating approximations involving (i) SRBMs in convex polyhedrons with a constant reflection vector field on each face of the polyhedron, and (ii) SRBMs in bounded domains with piecewise smooth boundaries and possibly nonconstant reflection vector fields on the boundary surfaces.
404|Finite Drude weight for 1D low temperature conductors|Dariush Heidarian and Sandro Sorella|We apply well established finite temperature Quantum Monte Carlo techniques to one dimensional Bose systems with soft and hardcore constraint, as well as to spinless fermion systems. We give clear and robust numerical evidence that, as expected, no superfluid density for Bosons or Meissner fraction for fermions. is possible at {\em any} non zero temperature in one dimensional interacting Bose or fermi lattice models, whereas a finite Drude weight is generally observed in gapless systems, in partial disagreement to previous expectations.
405|Density dependent hadronic models and the relation between neutron stars   and neutron skin thickness|S.S. Avancini, J.R. Marinelli, D.P. Menezes, M.M.W. de Moraes and C.   Provid\^encia|In the present work we investigate the main differences in the lead neutron skin thickness, binding energy, surface energy and density profiles obtained with two different density dependent relativistic hadronic models, within the Thomas-Fermi approximation. We show that the asymmetry parameter for low momentum transfer polarized electron scattering is not sensitive to the model parametrization differences.
406|Photoconductance of organic single-molecule contacts|J. K. Viljas, F. Pauly and J. C. Cuevas|We study the dc conductance of organic single-molecule contacts in the presence of external electromagnetic radiation (photoconductance). In agreement with previous predictions, we find that the radiation can lead to large enhancements of the conductance of such contacts by bringing off-resonant levels into resonance through photoassisted processes. In our analysis we make use of the simplifying fact that, under certain assumptions, the photoconductance can be expressed in terms of the transmission function in the absence of the radiation. The conductance enhancement is demonstrated for oligophenylene molecules between gold electrodes, whose electronic structure is calculated based on density-functional theory. It is shown that the exponential decay of the conductance with the length of the molecule can be replaced by a length-independent value in the presence of radiation.
407|On the over-barrier reflection in quantum mechanics with multiple   degrees of freedom|D.G. Levkov, A.G. Panin, S.M. Sibiryakov|We present an analytic example of two dimensional quantum mechanical system, where the exponential suppression of the probability of over-barrier reflection changes non-monotonically with energy. The suppression is minimal at certain "optimal" energies where reflection occurs with exponentially larger probability than at other energies.
408|Cyclotron Resonance study of the electron and hole velocity in graphene   monolayers|R.S. Deacon, K-C. Chuang, R. J.Nicholas, K.S. Novoselov, A.K. Geim|We report studies of cyclotron resonance in monolayer graphene. Cyclotron resonance is detected using the photoconductive response of the sample for several different Landau level occupancies. The experiments measure an electron velocity at the K- (Dirac) point of $c_{K}^{*}$ = 1.093 x 10$^{6}$ ms$^{-1}$ and in addition detect a significant asymmetry between the electron and hole bands, leading to a difference in the electron and hole velocities of 5% by energies of 125 meV away from the Dirac point.
409|Molecular circuits based on graphene nano-ribbon junctions|Zhiping Xu|Graphene nano-ribbons junctions based electronic devices are proposed in this Letter. Non-equilibrium Green function calculations show that nano-ribbon junctions tailored from single layer graphene with different edge shape and width can act as metal-semiconductor junctions and quantum dots can be implemented. In virtue of the possibilities of patterning monolayer graphene down to atomic precision, these structures, quite different from the previously reported two-dimensional bulk graphene or carbon nanotube devices, are expected to be used as the building blocks of the future nano-electronics.
410|Unit groups of integral finite group rings with no noncyclic abelian   finite subgroups|Martin Hertweck|It is shown that in the units of augmentation one of an integral group ring $\mathbb{Z} G$ of a finite group $G$, a noncyclic subgroup of order $p^{2}$, for some odd prime $p$, exists only if such a subgroup exists in $G$. The corresponding statement for $p=2$ holds by the Brauer--Suzuki theorem, as recently observed by W. Kimmerle.
411|Exotic Hadron in Pole-dominated QCD Sum Rules|Toru Kojo, Daisuke Jido and Arata Hayashigaki|We study pentaquark $\Theta^{+} (I=0,J=1/2)$ in the QCD sum rules emphasizing that we can not extract any properties of the pentaquark outside of the Borel window. To find the appropriate Borel window, we prepare a favorable set up of the correlators and carry out the operator product expansion up to dimension 15 within factorization hypothesis. Our procedures reduce the unwanted high energy contaminations and enhance the low energy correlation. In the Borel window, independent analyses for the chiral-even and odd sum rules give the consistent values of the $\Theta^+$ mass, $1.68\pm0.22$ GeV, and the residue. The parity is found to be {\it positive}.
412|Leaky modes of a left-handed slab|Antoine Moreau (LASMEA), Didier Felbacq (GES)|Using complex plane analysis we show that left-handed slab may support either leaky slab waves, which are backward because of negative refraction, or leaky surface waves, which are backward or forward depending on the propagation direction of the surface wave itself. Moreover, there is a general connection between the reflection coefficient of the left-handed slab and the one of the corresponding right-handed slab (with opposite permittivity and permeability) so that leaky slab modes are excited for the same angle of incidence of the impinging beam for both structures. Many negative giant lateral shifts can be explained by the excitation of these leaky modes.
413|Coulomb blockade of field emission from nanoscale conductors|O. E. Raichev|Theoretical description of the field emission of electrons from nanoscale objects weakly coupled to the cathode is presented. It is shown that the field- emission current increases in a step-like fashion due to single-electron charging which leads to abrupt changes of the effective electric field responsible for the field emission. A detailed consideration of the current-voltage characteristics is carried out for a nanocluster modelled by a metallic spherical particle in the close vicinity of the cathode and for a cylindrical silicon nanowire grown on the cathode surface.
414|Origamis with non congruence Veech groups|Gabriela Schmithuesen|As main result we show that for each g > 1 there is some translation surface of genus g whose Veech group is a non congruence subgroup of SL(2,Z). We use origamis/square-tiled surfaces to produce our examples. The article is divided into two parts: In the first part we introduce translation surfaces, origamis, Veech groups and Teichmueller curves and show for two origamis in genus 2 that their Veech groups are non congruence groups; in the second part we provide a technique that produces sequences of origamis whose Veech groups are decreasing. This is used to prove the main result.
415|Thermodynamic Stability - A note on a footnote in Ruelle's book|Bernhard Baumgartner|Thermodynamic stable interaction pair potentials which are not of the form ``positive function + real continuous function of positive type'' are presented in dimension one. Construction of such a potential in dimension two is sketched. These constructions use only elementary calculations. The mathematical background is discussed separately.
416|Entanglement entropy at infinite randomness fixed points in higher   dimensions|Yu-Cheng Lin, Ferenc Igloi and Heiko Rieger|The entanglement entropy of the two-dimensional random transverse Ising model is studied with a numerical implementation of the strong disorder renormalization group. The asymptotic behavior of the entropy per surface area diverges at, and only at, the quantum phase transition that is governed by an infinite randomness fixed point. Here we identify a double-logarithmic multiplicative correction to the area law for the entanglement entropy. This contrasts with the pure area law valid at the infinite randomness fixed point in the diluted transverse Ising model in higher dimensions.
417|Ultrasound attenuation of superfluid $^{3}$He in aerogel|H.C. Choi, N. Masuhara, B.H. Moon, P. Bhupathi, M.W. Meisel, Y. Lee,   N. Mulders, S. Higashitani, M. Miura, and K. Nagai|We have performed longitudinal ultrasound (9.5 MHz) attenuation measurements in the B-phase of superfluid $^3$He in 98% porosity aerogel down to the zero temperature limit for a wide range of pressures at zero magnetic field. The absolute attenuation was determined by direct transmission of sound pulses. Compared to the bulk fluid, our results revealed a drastically different behavior in attenuation, which is consistent with theoretical accounts with gapless excitations and a collision drag effect.
418|The Hourglass - Consequences of Pure Hamiltonian Evolution of a   Radiating System|Donald McCartor|Hourglass is the name given here to a formal isolated quantum system that can radiate. Starting from a time when it defines the system it represents clearly and no radiation is present, it is given straightforward Hamiltonian evolution. The question of what significance hourglasses have is raised, and this question is proposed to be more consequential than the measurement problem.
419|The Sigma-D Relation for Planetary Nebulae: Preliminary Analysis|D. Urosevic, B. Vukotic, B. Arbutina, D. Ilic|An analysis of the relation between radio surface brightness and diameter, so-called Sigma-D relation, for planetary nebulae (PNe) is presented: i) the theoretical Sigma-D relation for the evolution of bremsstrahlung surface brightness is derived; ii) contrary to the results obtained earlier for the Galactic supernova remnant (SNR) samples, our results show that the updated sample of Galactic PNe does not severely suffer from volume selection effect - Malmquist bias (same as for the extragalactic SNR samples) and; iii) we conclude that the empirical Sigma-D relation for PNe derived in this paper is not useful for valid determination of distances for all observed PNe with unknown distances.
420|Polarization conversion in a silica microsphere|Pablo Bianucci, Chris Fietz, John W. Robertson, Gennady Shvets and   Chih-Kang Shih|We experimentally demonstrate controlled polarization-selective phenomena in a whispering gallery mode resonator. We observed efficient ($\approx 75 %$) polarization conversion of light in a silica microsphere coupled to a tapered optical fiber with proper optimization of the polarization of the propagating light. A simple model treating the microsphere as a ring resonator provides a good fit to the observed behavior.
421|Limits on WIMP-nucleon interactions with CsI(Tl) crystal detectors|H. S. Lee, H. C. Bhang, J. H. Choi, H. Dao, I. S. Hahn, M. J. Hwang,   S. W. Jung, W. G. Kang, D. W. Kim, H. J. Kim, S. C. Kim, S. K. Kim, Y. D.   Kim, J. W. Kwak, Y. J. Kwon, J. Lee, J. H. Lee, J. I. Lee, M. J. Lee, S. J.   Lee, J. Li, X. Li, Y. J. Li, S. S. Myung, S. Ryu, J. H. So, Q. Yue, J. J. Zhu|The Korea Invisible Mass Search(KIMS) experiment presents new limits on WIMP-nucleon cross section using the data from an exposure of 3409 kgd taken with low background CsI(Tl) crystals at Yangyang underground laboratory. The most stringent limit on the spin dependent interaction for pure proton case is obtained. The DAMA signal region for both spin independent and spin dependent interactions for the WIMP mass higher than 20 GeV/c^2are excluded by the single experiment with crystal scintillators.
422|Stopping effects in U+U collisions with a beam energy of 520 MeV/nucleon|Xiao-Feng Luo, Xin Dong, Ming Shao, Ke-Jun Wu, Cheng Li, Hong-Fang   Chen, Hu-Shan Xu|A Relativistic Transport Model (ART1.0) is applied to simulate the stopping effects in tip-tip and body-body U+U collisions, at a beam kinetic energy of 520 MeV/nucleon. Our simulation results have demonstrated that both central collisions of the two extreme orientations can achieve full stopping, and also form a bulk of hot, dense nuclear matter with a sufficiently large volume and long duration, due to the largely deformed uranium nuclei. The nucleon sideward flow in the tip-tip collisions is nearly 3 times larger than that in body-body ones at normalized impact parameter $b/b_{max}<0.5$, and that the body-body central collisions have a largest negative nucleon elliptic flow $v_{2}=-12%$ in contrast to zero in tip-tip ones. Thus the extreme circumstance and the novel experimental observables in tip-tip and body-body collisions can provide a good condition and sensitive probe to study the nuclear EoS, respectively. The Cooling Storage Ring (CSR) External Target Facility (ETF) to be built at Lanzhou, China, delivering the uranium beam up to 520 MeV/nucleon is expected to make significant contribution to explore the nuclear equation of state (EoS).
423|QED for fields obeying a square root operator equation|Tobias Gleim|Instead of using local field equations - like the Dirac equation for spin-1/2 and the Klein-Gordon equation for spin-0 particles - one could try to use non-local field equations in order to describe scattering processes. The latter equations can be obtained by means of the relativistic energy together with the correspondence principle, resulting in equations with a square root operator. By coupling them to an electromagnetic field and expanding the square root (and taking into account terms of quadratic order in the electromagnetic coupling constant e), it is possible to calculate scattering matrix elements within the framework of quantum electrodynamics, e.g. like those for Compton scattering or for the scattering of two identical particles. This will be done here for the scalar case. These results are then compared with the corresponding ones based on the Klein-Gordon equation. A proposal of how to transfer these reflections to the spin-1/2 case is also presented.
424|Feedback from first radiation sources: H- photodissociation|Leonid Chuzhoy, Michael Kuhlen, Paul R. Shapiro|During the epoch of reionization, the formation of radiation sources is accompanied by the growth of a H- photodissociating flux. We estimate the impact of this flux on the formation of molecular hydrogen and cooling in the first galaxies, assuming different types of radiation sources (e.g. Pop II and Pop III stars, miniquasars). We find that H- photodissociation reduces the formation of H2 molecules by a factor of ~1+1000k_s*x/(f_esc*delta), where x is the mean ionized fraction in the IGM, f_esc is the fraction of ionizing photons that escape from their progenitor halos, delta is the local gas overdensity and k_s is an order unity constant which depends on the type of radiation source. By the time a significant fraction of the universe becomes ionized, H- photodissociation may significantly reduce the H2 abundance and, with it, the primordial star formation rate, delaying the progress of reionization.
425|The 3D +-J Ising model at the ferromagnetic transition line|Martin Hasenbusch, Francesco Parisen Toldin, Andrea Pelissetto, Ettore   Vicari|We study the critical behavior of the three-dimensional $\pm J$ Ising model [with a random-exchange probability $P(J_{xy}) = p \delta(J_{xy} - J) + (1-p) \delta(J_{xy} + J)$] at the transition line between the paramagnetic and ferromagnetic phase, which extends from $p=1$ to a multicritical (Nishimori) point at $p=p_N\approx 0.767$. By a finite-size scaling analysis of Monte Carlo simulations at various values of $p$ in the region $p_N<p<1$, we provide strong numerical evidence that the critical behavior along the ferromagnetic transition line belongs to the same universality class as the three-dimensional randomly-dilute Ising model. We obtain the results $\nu=0.682(3)$ and $\eta=0.036(2)$ for the critical exponents, which are consistent with the estimates $\nu=0.683(2)$ and $\eta=0.036(1)$ at the transition of randomly-dilute Ising models.
426|Star Formation in the Bok Globule CB54|David R. Ciardi and Cynthia Gomez Martin|We present mid-infrared (10.4 \micron, 11.7 \micron, and 18.3 \micron) imaging intended to locate and characterize the suspected protostellar components within the Bok globule CB54. We detect and confirm the protostellar status for the near-infrared source CB54YC1-II. The mid-infrared luminosity for CB54YC1-II was found to be $L_{midir} \approx 8 L_\sun$, and we estimate a central source mass of $M_* \approx 0.8 M_\sun$ (for a mass accretion rate of ${\dot M}=10^{-6} M_\sun yr^{-1}$). CB54 harbors another near-infrared source (CB54YC1-I), which was not detected by our observations. The non-detection is consistent with CB54YC1-I being a highly extinguished embedded young A or B star or a background G or F giant. An alternative explanation for CB54YC1-I is that the source is an embedded protostar viewed at an extremely high inclination angle, and the near-infrared detections are not of the central protostar, but of light scattered by the accretion disk into our line of sight. In addition, we have discovered three new mid-infrared sources, which are spatially coincident with the previously known dense core in CB54. The source temperatures ($\sim100$K) and association of the mid-infrared sources with the dense core suggests that these mid-infrared objects may be embedded class 0 protostars.
427|Quantitative Resolution to some "Absolute Discrepancies" in Cancer   Theories: a View from Phage lambda Genetic Switch|P. Ao|Is it possible to understand cancer? Or more specifically, is it possible to understand cancer from genetic side? There already many answers in literature. The most optimistic one has claimed that it is mission-possible. Duesberg and his colleagues reviewed the impressive amount of research results on cancer accumulated over 100 years. It confirms the a general opinion that considering all available experimental results and clinical observations there is no cancer theory without major difficulties, including the prevailing gene-based cancer theories. They have then listed 9 "absolute discrepancies" for such cancer theory. In this letter the quantitative evidence against one of their major reasons for dismissing mutation cancer theory, by both in vivo experiment and a first principle computation, is explicitly pointed out.
428|Reduced phase space and toric variety coordinatizations of Delzant   spaces|J.J. Duistermaat and A. Pelayo|In this note we describe the natural coordinatizations of a Delzant space defined as a reduced phase space (symplectic geometry view-point) and give explicit formulas for the coordinate transformations. For each fixed point of the torus action on the Delzant polytope, we have a maximal coordinatization of an open cell in the Delzant space which contains the fixed point. This cell is equal to the domain of definition of one of the natural coordinatizations of the Delzant space as a toric variety (complex algebraic geometry view-point), and we give an explicit formula for the toric variety coordinates in terms of the reduced phase space coordinates. We use considerations in the maximal coordinate neighborhoods to give simple proofs of some of the basic facts about the Delzant space, as a reduced phase space, and as a toric variety. These can be viewed as a first application of the coordinatizations, and serve to make the presentation more self-contained.
429|Fragmentation of general relativistic quasi-toroidal polytropes|Burkhard Zink, Nikolaos Stergioulas, Ian Hawke, Christian D. Ott, Erik   Schnetter, Ewald Mueller|We investigate the role of rotational instabilities in the context of black hole formation in relativistic stars. In addition to the standard scenario - an axially symmetric dynamical instability forming a horizon at the star's center - the recently found low-$T/W$ instabilities are shown to lead to fragmentation and off-center horizon formation in differentially rotating stars. This process might be an alternative pathway to produce SMBHs from supermassive stars with inefficient angular momentum transport.
430|A Survey of Huebschmann and Stasheff's Paper: Formal Solution of the   Master Equation via HPT and Deformation Theory|Fusun Akman and Lucian M. Ionescu|These notes, based on the paper "Formal Solution of the Master Equation via HPT and Deformation Theory" by Huebschmann and Stasheff, were prepared for a series of talks at Illinois State University with the intention of applying Homological Perturbation Theory to the derived bracket constructions of Kosmann-Schwarzbach and T. Voronov, and eventually writing Part II of the paper "Higher Derived Brackets and Deformation Theory I" by the present authors.
431|A variational formulation of electrodynamics with external sources|Antonio De Nicola, Wlodzimierz M. Tulczyjew|We present a variational formulation of electrodynamics using de Rham even and odd differential forms. Our formulation relies on a variational principle more complete than the Hamilton principle and thus leads to field equations with external sources and permits the derivation of the constitutive relations. We interpret a domain in space-time as an odd de Rham 4-current. This permits a treatment of different types of boundary problems in an unified way. In particular we obtain a smooth transition to the infinitesimal version by using a current with a one point support.
432|Protein and ionic surfactants - promoters and inhibitors of contact line   pinning|Viatcheslav V. Berejnov|We report a new effect of surfactants in pinning a drop contact line, specifically that lysozyme promotes while lauryl sulfate inhibits pinning. We explain the pinning disparity assuming difference in wetting: the protein-laden drop wets a "clean" surface and the surfactant-laden drop wets an auto-precursored surface.
433|Type D Einstein spacetimes in higher dimensions|Vojtech Pravda, Alena Pravdova, Marcello Ortaggio|We show that all static spacetimes in higher dimensions are of Weyl types G, I_i, D or O. This applies also to stationary spacetimes if additional conditions are fulfilled, as for most known black hole/ring solutions. (The conclusions change when the Killing generator becomes null, such as at Killing horizons.) Next we demonstrate that the same Weyl types characterize warped product spacetimes with a one-dimensional Lorentzian (timelike) factor, whereas warped spacetimes with a two-dimensional Lorentzian factor are restricted to the types D or O. By exploring the Bianchi identities, we then analyze the simplest non-trivial case from the above classes - type D vacuum spacetimes, possibly with a cosmological constant, dropping, however, the assumptions that the spacetime is static, stationary or warped. It is shown that for ``generic'' type D vacuum spacetimes the corresponding principal null directions are geodetic in any dimension (this applies also to type II spacetimes). For n>=5, however, there may exist particular cases of type D spacetimes which admit non-geodetic multiple principal null directions and we present such examples in any n>=7. Further studies are restricted to five dimensions, where the type D Weyl tensor is described by a 3x3 matrix \Phi_{ij}. In the case with ``twistfree'' (A_{ij}=0) principal null geodesics we show that in a ``generic'' case \Phi_{ij} is symmetric and eigenvectors of \Phi_{ij} coincide with those of the expansion matrix S_{ij}, providing us with three preferred spacelike directions of the spacetime. Similar results are also obtained when relaxing the twistfree condition and assuming instead that \Phi_{ij} is symmetric. The n=5 Myers-Perry black hole and Kerr-NUT-AdS metrics in arbitrary dimension are briefly studied as specific examples of type D vacuum spacetime.
434|Eigen Equation of the Nonlinear Spinor|Ying-Qiu Gu, Ta-tsien Li|How to effectively solve the eigen solutions of the nonlinear spinor field equation coupling with some other interaction fields is important to understand the behavior of the elementary particles. In this paper, we derive a simplified form of the eigen equation of the nonlinear spinor, and then propose a scheme to solve their numerical solutions. This simplified equation has elegant and neat structure, which is more convenient for both theoretical analysis and numerical computation.
435|Measurement of B(D_S^+ --> ell^+ nu) and the Decay Constant f_D_{S^+}|CLEO Collaboration: T. K. Pedlar, et al|We examine e+e- --> Ds- Ds*+ and Ds*- Ds+ interactions at 4170 MeV using the CLEO-c detector in order to measure the decay constant fDs+. We use the Ds+ --> l+ nu channel, where the l+ designates either a mu+ or a tau+, when the tau+ --> pi+ nu. Analyzing both modes independently, we determine B(Ds+ --> mu+ nu) = (0.594 +- 0.066 +- 0.031)%, and B(Ds+ --> tau+ nu) = (8.0 +- 1.3 +- 0.4)%. We also analyze them simultaneously to find an effective value of B{eff}(Ds+ --> mu+ nu) = (0.638 +- 0.059 +- 0.033)% and extract fDs = (274 +- 13 +- 7) MeV. Combining with our previous determination of B(D+ -> mu+ nu), we also find the ratio fDs/fD+ = 1.23 +- 0.11 +- 0.04. We compare to current theoretical estimates. Finally, we find B(Ds+ --> e+ nu) < 1.3 x10^{-4} at 90% confidence level.
436|Broadening the Higgs Boson with Right-Handed Neutrinos and a Higher   Dimension Operator at the Electroweak Scale|Michael L. Graesser|The existence of certain TeV suppressed higher-dimension operators may open up new decay channels for the Higgs boson to decay into lighter right-handed neutrinos. These channels may dominate over all other channels if the Higgs boson is light. For a Higgs boson mass larger than $2 m_W$ the new decays are subdominant yet still of interest. The right-handed neutrinos have macroscopic decay lengths and decay mostly into final states containing leptons and quarks. A distinguishing collider signature of this scenario is a pair of displaced vertices violating lepton number. A general operator analysis is performed using the minimal flavor violation hypothesis to illustrate that these novel decay processes can occur while remaining consistent with experimental constraints on lepton number violating processes. In this context the question of whether these new decay modes dominate is found to depend crucially on the approximate flavor symmetries of the right-handed neutrinos.
437|Coulomb blockade of anyons|Dmitri V. Averin and James A. Nesteroff|Coulomb interaction turns anyonic quasiparticles of a primary quantum Hall liquid with filling factor $\nu =1/(2m+1)$ into hard-core anyons. We have developed a model of coherent transport of such quasiparticles in systems of multiple antidots by extending the Wigner-Jordan description of 1D abelian anyons to tunneling problems. We show that the anyonic exchange statistics manifests itself in tunneling conductance even in the {\em absence} of quasiparticle exchanges. In particular, it can be seen as a non-vanishing resonant peak associated with quasiparticle tunneling through a line of three antidots.
438|Dynamics of a quantum phase transition in a ferromagnetic Bose-Einstein   condensate|Bogdan Damski and Wojciech H. Zurek|We discuss dynamics of a slow quantum phase transition in a spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensate. We determine analytically the scaling properties of the system magnetization and verify them with numerical simulations in a one dimensional model.
439|Evidence for a planetary companion around a nearby young star|J. Setiawan (1), P. Weise (1), Th. Henning (1), R. Launhardt (1), A.   M\"uller (1), J. Rodmann (2) ((1) Max Planck Institute for Astronomy,   Heidelberg, Germany, (2) European Space Agency / ESTEC, Noordwijk, The   Netherlands)|We report evidence for a planetary companion around the nearby young star HD 70573. The star is a G type dwarf located at a distance of 46 pc with age estimation between 20 and 300 Myrs. We carried out spectroscopic observations of this star with FEROS at the 2.2 m MPG/ESO telescope at La Silla. Our spectroscopic analysis yields a spectral type of G1-1.5V and an age of about 100 Myrs. Variations in stellar radial velocity of HD 70573 have been monitored since December 2003 until January 2007. The velocity accuracy of FEROS within this period is about 10 m/s. HD 70573 shows a radial velocity variation with a period of 852 +/- 12 days and a semi-amplitude of 149 +/- 6 m/s. The period of this variation is significantly longer than its rotational period, which is 3.3 days. Based on the analysis of the Ca II K emission line, Halpha and Teff variation as stellar activity indicators as well as the lack of a correlation between the bisector velocity span and the radial velocity, we can exclude the rotational modulation and non-radial pulsations as the source of the long-period radial velocity variation. Thus, the presence of a low-mass companion around the star provides the best explanation for the observed radial velocity variation. Assuming a primary mass m1=1.0 +/- 0.1 Msun for the host star, we calculated a minimum mass of the companion m2sini of 6.1 Mjup, which lies in the planetary mass regime, and an orbital semi-major axis of 1.76 AU. The orbit of the planet has an eccentricity of e=0.4. The planet discovery around the young star HD 70573 gives an important input for the study of debris disks around young stars and their relation to the presence of planets.
440|Quantum electromagnetic X-waves|Alessandro Ciattoni, Claudio Conti|We show that two distinct quantum states of the electromagnetic field can be associated to a classical vector X wave or a propagation-invariant solution of Maxwell equations. The difference between the two states is of pure quantum mechanical origin since they are internally entangled and disentangled, respectively and can be generated by different linear or nonlinear processes. Detection and generation of Schr\"odinger-cat states comprising two entangled X-waves and their possible applications are discussed.
441|Neutron-neutron scattering length from the reaction gamma d --> pi^+ nn   employing chiral perturbation theory|V. Lensky, V. Baru, E. Epelbaum, C. Hanhart, J. Haidenbauer, A.   Kudryavtsev, Ulf-G. Mei{\ss}ner|We discuss the possibility to extract the neutron-neutron scattering length a_{nn} from experimental spectra on the reaction gamma d --> pi^+ nn. The transition operator is calculated to high accuracy from chiral perturbation theory. We argue that for properly chosen kinematics, the theoretical uncertainty of the method can be as low as 0.1 fm.
442|Multiple Unfoldings of Orbifold Singularities: Engineering Geometric   Analogies to Unification|Jacob L. Bourjaily|Katz and Vafa showed how charged matter can arise geometrically by the deformation of ADE-type orbifold singularities in type IIa, M-theory, and F-theory compactifications. In this paper we use those same basic ingredients, used there to geometrically engineer specific matter representations, here to deform the compactification manifold itself in a way which naturally compliments many features of unified model building. We realize this idea explicitly by deforming a manifold engineered to give rise to an $SU_5$ grand unified model into a one giving rise to the Standard Model. In this framework, the relative local positions of the singularities giving rise to Standard Model fields are specified in terms of the values of a small number of complex structure moduli which deform the original manifold, greatly reducing the arbitrariness of their relative positions.
443|Geometrically Engineering the Standard Model: Locally Unfolding Three   Families out of E8|Jacob L. Bourjaily|This paper extends and builds upon the results of an earlier paper, in which we described how to use the tools of geometrical engineering to deform geometrically-engineered grand unified models into ones with lower symmetry. This top-down unfolding has the advantage that the relative positions of singularities giving rise to the many `low energy' matter fields are related by only a few parameters which deform the geometry of the unified model. And because the relative positions of singularities are necessary to compute the superpotential, for example, this is a framework in which the arbitrariness of geometrically engineered models can be greatly reduced.   In our earlier paper, this picture was made concrete for the case of deforming the representations of an SU(5) model into their Standard Model content. In this paper we continue that discussion to show how a geometrically engineered 16 of SO(10) can be unfolded into the Standard Model, and how the three families of the Standard Model uniquely emerge from the unfolding of a single, isolated E8 singularity.
444|The classification of surfaces with p_g=q=1 isogenous to a product of   curves|Giovanna Carnovale, Francesco Polizzi|A projective surface S is said to be isogenous to a product if there exist two smooth curves C, F and a finite group G acting freely on C \times F so that S=(C \times F)/G. In this paper we classify all surfaces with p_g=q=1 which are isogenous to a product.
445|Manipulating the rotational properties of a two-component Bose gas|J. Christensson (1), S. Bargi (1), K. Karkkainen (1), Y. Yu (1), G. M.   Kavoulakis (1), M. Manninen (2), and S. M. Reimann (1) ((1) LTH, Lund, (2)   Jyvaskyla)|A rotating, two-component Bose-Einstein condensate is shown to exhibit vortices of multiple quantization, which are possible due to the interatomic interactions between the two species. Also, persistent currents are absent in this system. Finally, the order parameter has a very simple structure for a range of angular momenta.
446|Giant Planet Migration in Viscous Power-Law Discs|R. G. Edgar|Many extra-solar planets discovered over the past decade are gas giants in tight orbits around their host stars. Due to the difficulties of forming these `hot Jupiters' in situ, they are generally assumed to have migrated to their present orbits through interactions with their nascent discs. In this paper, we present a systematic study of giant planet migration in power law discs. We find that the planetary migration rate is proportional to the disc surface density. This is inconsistent with the assumption that the migration rate is simply the viscous drift speed of the disc. However, this result can be obtained by balancing the angular momentum of the planet with the viscous torque in the disc. We have verified that this result is not affected by adjusting the resolution of the grid, the smoothing length used, or the time at which the planet is released to migrate.
447|Worldsheet Instantons and Torsion Curves, Part B: Mirror Symmetry|Volker Braun, Maximilian Kreuzer, Burt A. Ovrut, Emanuel Scheidegger|We apply mirror symmetry to the problem of counting holomorphic rational curves in a Calabi-Yau threefold X with Z_3 x Z_3 Wilson lines. As we found in Part A [hep-th/0703182], the integral homology group H_2(X,Z)=Z^3 + Z_3 + Z_3 contains torsion curves. Using the B-model on the mirror of X as well as its covering spaces, we compute the instanton numbers. We observe that X is self-mirror even at the quantum level. Using the self-mirror property, we derive the complete prepotential on X, going beyond the results of Part A. In particular, this yields the first example where the instanton number depends on the torsion part of its homology class. Another consequence is that the threefold X provides a non-toric example for the conjectured exchange of torsion subgroups in mirror manifolds.
448|Disorder screening near the Mott-Anderson transition|M. C. O. Aguiar, V. Dobrosavljevic, E. Abrahams, G. Kotliar|Correlation-driven screening of disorder is studied within the typical-medium dynamical mean-field theory (TMT-DMFT) of the Mott-Anderson transition. In the strongly correlated regime, the site energies epsilon_R^i characterizing the effective disorder potential are strongly renormalized due to the phenomenon of Kondo pinning. This effect produces very strong screening when the interaction U is stronger then disorder W, but applies only to a fraction of the sites in the opposite limit (U<W).
449|Electromigrated nanoscale gaps for surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy|D.R. Ward, N.K. Grady, C.S. Levin, N.J. Halas, Y. Wu, P. Nordlander,   D. Natelson|Single-molecule detection with chemical specificity is a powerful and much desired tool for biology, chemistry, physics, and sensing technologies. Surface-enhanced spectroscopies enable single molecule studies, yet reliable substrates of adequate sensitivity are in short supply. We present a simple, scaleable substrate for surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) incorporating nanometer-scale electromigrated gaps between extended electrodes. Molecules in the nanogap active regions exhibit hallmarks of very high Raman sensitivity, including blinking and spectral diffusion. Electrodynamic simulations show plasmonic focusing, giving electromagnetic enhancements approaching those needed for single-molecule SERS.
450|Dramatic Variability of X-ray Absorption Lines in the Black Hole   Candidate Cygnus X-1|Chulhoon Chang and Wei Cui|We report results from a 30 ks observation of Cygnus X-1 with the High Energy Transmission Grating Spectrometer (HETGS) on board the {\em Chandra X-ray Observatory}. Numerous absorption lines were detected in the HETGS spectrum. The lines are associated with highly ionized Ne, Na, Mg, Al, Si, S, and Fe, some of which have been seen in earlier HETGS observations. Surprisingly, however, we discovered dramatic variability of the lines over the duration of the present observation. For instance, the flux of the Ne X line at 12.14 \AA\ was about $5 \times 10^{-3}$ photons cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ in the early part of the observation but became subsequently undetectable, with a 99% upper limit of $0.06 \times 10^{-3}$ photons cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ on the flux of the line. This implies that the line weakened by nearly two orders of magnitude on a timescale of hours. The overall X-ray flux of the source did also vary during the observation but only by 20--30%. For Cyg X-1, the absorption lines are generally attributed to the absorption of X-rays by ionized stellar wind in the binary system. Therefore, they may provide valuable diagnostics on the physical condition of the wind. We discuss the implications of the results.
451|Antiferromagnetism-superconductivity competition in electron-doped   cuprates triggered by oxygen reduction|P. Richard, M. Neupane, Y.-M. Xu, P. Fournier, S. Li, Pengcheng Dai,   Z. Wang and H. Ding|We have performed a systematic angle-resolved photoemission study of as-grown and oxygen-reduced Pr$_{2-x}$Ce$_x$CuO$_4$ and Pr$_{1-x}$LaCe$_{x}$CuO$_4$ electron-doped cuprates. In contrast to the common belief, neither the band filling nor the band parameters are significantly affected by the oxygen reduction process. Instead, we show that the main electronic role of the reduction process is to remove an anisotropic leading edge gap around the Fermi surface. While the nodal leading edge gap is induced by long-range antiferomagnetic order, the origin of the antinodal one remains unclear.
452|An Extrasolar Planet Census with a Space-based Microlensing Survey|D.P. Bennett, J. Anderson, J.-P. Beaulieu, I. Bond, E. Cheng, K. Cook,   S. Friedman, B.S. Gaudi, A. Gould, J. Jenkins, R. Kimble, D. Lin, M. Rich, K.   Sahu, D. Tenerelli, A. Udalski, and P. Yock|A space-based gravitational microlensing exoplanet survey will provide a statistical census of exoplanets with masses down to 0.1 Earth-masses and orbital separations ranging from 0.5AU to infinity. This includes analogs to all the Solar System's planets except for Mercury, as well as most types of planets predicted by planet formation theories. Such a survey will provide results on the frequency of planets around all types of stars except those with short lifetimes. Close-in planets with separations < 0.5 AU are invisible to a space-based microlensing survey, but these can be found by Kepler. Other methods, including ground-based microlensing, cannot approach the comprehensive statistics on the mass and semi-major axis distribution of extrasolar planets that a space-based microlensing survey will provide. The terrestrial planet sensitivity of a ground-based microlensing survey is limited to the vicinity of the Einstein radius at 2-3 AU, and space-based imaging is needed to identify and determine the mass of the planetary host stars for the vast majority of planets discovered by microlensing. Thus, a space-based microlensing survey is likely to be the only way to gain a comprehensive understanding of the nature of planetary systems, which is needed to understand planet formation and habitability. The proposed Microlensing Planet Finder (MPF) mission is an example of a space-based microlensing survey that can accomplish these objectives with proven technology and a cost that fits comfortably under the NASA Discovery Program cost cap.
453|USco1606-1935: An Unusually Wide Low-Mass Triple System?|Adam L. Kraus, Lynne A. Hillenbrand (Caltech)|We present photometric, astrometric, and spectroscopic observations of USco160611.9-193532 AB, a candidate ultrawide (~1600 AU), low-mass (M_tot~0.4 M_sun) multiple system in the nearby OB association Upper Scorpius. We conclude that both components are young, comoving members of the association; we also present high-resolution observations which show that the primary is itself a close binary system. If the Aab and B components are gravitationally bound, the system would fall into the small class of young multiple systems which have unusually wide separations as compared to field systems of similar mass. However, we demonstrate that physical association can not be assumed purely on probabilistic grounds for any individual candidate system in this separation range. Analysis of the association's two-point correlation function shows that there is a significant probability (25%) that at least one pair of low-mass association members will be separated in projection by <15", so analysis of the wide binary population in Upper Sco will require a systematic search for all wide systems; the detection of another such pair would represent an excess at the 98% confidence level.
454|Particle propagation in cosmological backgrounds|Daniel Arteaga|We study the quantum propagation of particles in cosmological backgrounds, by considering a doublet of massive scalar fields propagating in an expanding universe, possibly filled with radiation. We focus on the dissipative effects related to the expansion rate. At first order, we recover the expected result that the decay rate is determined by the local temperature. Beyond linear order, the decay rate has an additional contribution governed by the expansion parameter. This latter contribution is present even for stable particles in the vacuum. Finally, we analyze the long time behaviour of the propagator and briefly discuss applications to the trans-Planckian question.
455|Quantum analysis of a linear DC SQUID mechanical displacement detector|M. P. Blencowe, E. Buks|We provide a quantum analysis of a DC SQUID mechanical displacement detector within the sub-critical Josephson current regime. A segment of the SQUID loop forms the mechanical resonator and motion of the latter is transduced inductively through changes in the flux threading the loop. Expressions are derived for the detector signal response and noise, which are used to evaluate the position and force detection sensitivity. We also investigate cooling of the mechanical resonator due to back reaction noise from the detector.
456|Rotation Measures of Extragalactic Sources Behind the Southern Galactic   Plane: New Insights into the Large-Scale Magnetic Field of the Inner Milky   Way|J.C. Brown, M. Haverkorn, B.M. Gaensler, A.R. Taylor, N.S. Bizunok,   N.M. McClure-Griffiths, J.M. Dickey, A.J. Green|We present new Faraday rotation measures (RMs) for 148 extragalactic radio sources behind the southern Galactic plane (253o < l < 356o, b < 1.5o), and use these data in combination with published data to probe the large-scale structure of the Milky Way's magnetic field. We show that the magnitudes of these RMs oscillate with longitude in a manner that correlates with the locations of the Galactic spiral arms. The observed pattern in RMs requries the presence of at least one large-scale magnetic reversal in the fourth Galactic quadrant, located between the Sagittarius- Carina and Scutum-Crux spiral arms. To quantitatively compare our measurements to other recent studies, we consider all available extragalactic and pulsar RMs in the region we have surveyed, and jointly fit these data to simple models in which the large-scale field follows the spiral arms. In the best-fitting model, the magnetic field in the fourth Galactic quadrant is directed clockwise in the Sagittarius-Carina spiral arm (as viewed from the North Galactic pole), but is oriented counter- clockwise in the Scutum-Crux arm. This contrasts with recent analyses of pulsar RMs alone, in which the fourth-quadrant field was presumed to be directed counter-clockwise in the Sagittarius- Carina arm. Also in contrast to recent pulsar RM studies, our joint modeling of pulsar and extragalactic RMs demonstrates that large numbers of large-scale magnetic field reversals are not required to account for observations.
457|On iterated image size for point-symmetric relations|Yahya Ould Hamidoune|Let $\Gamma =(V,E)$ be a point-symmetric reflexive relation and let $v\in V$ such that   $\Gamma (v)$ is finite (and hence $\Gamma (x)$ is finite for all $x$, by the transitive action of the group of automorphisms). Let $j\in \N$ be an integer such that $\Gamma ^j(v)\cap \Gamma ^{-}(v)=\{v\}$. Our main result states that   $$ \Gamma ^{j} (v)\ge  \Gamma ^{j-1} (v) + \Gamma (v)-1.$$   As an application we have $ \Gamma ^{j} (v) \ge 1+(\Gamma (v)-1)j.$ The last result confirms a recent conjecture of Seymour in the case of vertex-symmetric graphs. Also it gives a short proof for the validity of the Caccetta-H\"aggkvist conjecture for vertex-symmetric graphs and generalizes an additive result of Shepherdson.

It consists of a small-aperture, wide-field automated telescope located at Winer Observatory near Sonoita, Arizona. The telescope surveys a set of 26 x 26 degree fields, together covering about 25% of the Northern sky, targeting stars in the range of 8<V<10 mag, searching for transits by close-in Jupiters. This paper describes the system hardware and software and discusses the quality of the observations. We show that KELT is able to achieve the necessary photometric precision to detect planetary transits around solar-type main sequence stars.
459|Entanglement increase from local interactions with   not-completely-positive maps|Thomas F. Jordan, Anil Shaji and E. C. G. Sudarshan|Simple examples are constructed that show the entanglement of two qubits being both increased and decreased by interactions on just one of them. One of the two qubits interacts with a third qubit, a control, that is never entangled or correlated with either of the two entangled qubits and is never entangled, but becomes correlated, with the system of those two qubits. The two entangled qubits do not interact, but their state can change from maximally entangled to separable or from separable to maximally entangled. Similar changes for the two qubits are made with a swap operation between one of the qubits and a control; then there are compensating changes of entanglement that involve the control. When the entanglement increases, the map that describes the change of the state of the two entangled qubits is not completely positive. Combination of two independent interactions that individually give exponential decay of the entanglement can cause the entanglement to not decay exponentially but, instead, go to zero at a finite time.
460|Extended solar emission - an analysis of the EGRET data|Elena Orlando, Dirk Petry and Andrew Strong|The Sun was recently predicted to be an extended source of gamma-ray emission, produced by inverse-Compton scattering of cosmic-ray electrons with the solar radiation. The emission was predicted to contribute to the diffuse extragalactic background even at large angular distances from the Sun. While this emission is expected to be readily detectable in future by GLAST, the situation for available EGRET data is more challenging. We present a detailed study of the EGRET database, using a time dependent analysis, accounting for the effect of the emission from 3C 279, the moon, and other sources, which interfere with the solar signal. The technique has been tested on the moon signal, with results consistent with previous work. We find clear evidence for emission from the Sun and its vicinity. The observations are compared with our model for the extended emission.
461|Mass and Temperature of the TWA 7 Debris Disk|B. C. Matthews (Herzberg Institute of Astrophysics, Canada), P. G.   Kalas (UC Berkeley, U.S.A.), M. C. Wyatt (University of Cambridge, U.K.)|We present photometric detections of dust emission at 850 and 450 micron around the pre-main sequence M1 dwarf TWA 7 using the SCUBA camera on the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope. These data confirm the presence of a cold dust disk around TWA 7, a member of the TW Hydrae Association. Based on the 850 micron flux, we estimate the mass of the disk to be 18 lunar masses (0.2 Earth masses) assuming a mass opacity of 1.7 cm^2/g with a temperature of 45 K. This makes the TWA 7 disk (d=55 pc) an order of magnitude more massive than the disk reported around AU Microscopii (GL 803), the closest (9.9 pc) debris disk detected around an M dwarf. This is consistent with TWA 7 being slightly younger than AU Mic. We find that the mid-IR and submillimeter data require the disk to be comprised of dust at a range of temperatures. A model in which the dust is at a single radius from the star, with a range of temperatures according to grain size, is as effective at fitting the emission spectrum as a model in which the dust is of uniform size, but has a range of temperatures according to distance. We discuss this disk in the context of known disks in the TW Hydrae Association and around low-mass stars; a comparison of masses of disks in the TWA reveals no trend in mass or evolutionary state (gas-rich vs. debris) as a function of spectral type.
462|Annealed importance sampling of dileucine peptide|Edward Lyman and Daniel M. Zuckerman|Annealed importance sampling is a means to assign equilibrium weights to a nonequilibrium sample that was generated by a simulated annealing protocol. The weights may then be used to calculate equilibrium averages, and also serve as an ``adiabatic signature'' of the chosen cooling schedule. In this paper we demonstrate the method on the 50-atom dileucine peptide, showing that equilibrium distributions are attained for manageable cooling schedules. For this system, as naively implemented here, the method is modestly more efficient than constant temperature simulation. However, the method is worth considering whenever any simulated heating or cooling is performed (as is often done at the beginning of a simulation project, or during an NMR structure calculation), as it is simple to implement and requires minimal additional CPU expense. Furthermore, the naive implementation presented here can be improved.
463|A General Nonlinear Fokker-Planck Equation and its Associated Entropy|Veit Schwammle, Evaldo M. F. Curado, Fernando D. Nobre|A recently introduced nonlinear Fokker-Planck equation, derived directly from a master equation, comes out as a very general tool to describe phenomenologically systems presenting complex behavior, like anomalous diffusion, in the presence of external forces. Such an equation is characterized by a nonlinear diffusion term that may present, in general, two distinct powers of the probability distribution. Herein, we calculate the stationary-state distributions of this equation in some special cases, and introduce associated classes of generalized entropies in order to satisfy the H-theorem. Within this approach, the parameters associated with the transition rates of the original master-equation are related to such generalized entropies, and are shown to obey some restrictions. Some particular cases are discussed.
464|Conduction electron spin-lattice relaxation time in the MgB2   superconductor|F. Simon, F. Mur\'anyi, T. Feh\'er, A. J\'anossy, L. Forr\'o, C.   Petrovic, S.L. Bud'ko, P.C. Canfield|The spin-lattice relaxation time, $T_{1}$, of conduction electrons is measured as a function of temperature and magnetic field in MgB$_2$. The method is based on the detection of the $z$ component of the conduction electron magnetization under electron spin resonance conditions with amplitude modulated microwave excitation. Measurement of $T_{1}$ below $T_c$ at 0.32 T allows to disentangle contributions from the two Fermi surfaces of MgB$_{2}$ as this field restores normal state on the Fermi surface part with $\pi$ symmetry only.
465|Modeling Accretion Disk X-ray Continuum of Black Hole Candidates|Gabor Pszota and Wei Cui|We critically examine issues associated with determining the fundamental properties of the black hole and the surrounding accretion disk in an X-ray binary based on modeling the disk X-ray continuum of the source. We base our work mainly on two XMM-Newton observations of GX 339-4, because they provided high-quality data at low energies (below 1 keV) which are critical for reliably modeling the spectrum of the accretion disk. A key issue examined is the determination of the so-called "color correction factor", which is often empirically introduced to account for the deviation of the local disk spectrum from a blackbody (due to electron scattering). This factor cannot be pre-determined theoretically because it may vary with, e.g., mass accretion rate, among a number of important factors. We follow up on an earlier suggestion to estimate the color correction observationally by modeling the disk spectrum with saturated Compton scattering. We show that the spectra can be fitted well and the approach yields reasonable values for the color correction factor. For comparison, we have also attempted to fit the spectra with other models. We show that even the high-soft-state continuum (which is dominated by the disk emission) cannot be satisfactorily fitted by state-of-the-art disk models. We discuss the implication of the results.
466|Inapproximability of Maximum Weighted Edge Biclique and Its Applications|Jinsong Tan|Given a bipartite graph $G = (V_1,V_2,E)$ where edges take on {\it both} positive and negative weights from set $\mathcal{S}$, the {\it maximum weighted edge biclique} problem, or $\mathcal{S}$-MWEB for short, asks to find a bipartite subgraph whose sum of edge weights is maximized. This problem has various applications in bioinformatics, machine learning and databases and its (in)approximability remains open. In this paper, we show that for a wide range of choices of $\mathcal{S}$, specifically when $ \frac{\min\mathcal{S}} {\max \mathcal{S}}  \in \Omega(\eta^{\delta-1/2}) \cap O(\eta^{1/2-\delta})$ (where $\eta = \max\{V_1, V_2\}$, and $\delta \in (0,1/2]$), no polynomial time algorithm can approximate $\mathcal{S}$-MWEB within a factor of $n^{\epsilon}$ for some $\epsilon > 0$ unless $\mathsf{RP = NP}$. This hardness result gives justification of the heuristic approaches adopted for various applied problems in the aforementioned areas, and indicates that good approximation algorithms are unlikely to exist. Specifically, we give two applications by showing that: 1) finding statistically significant biclusters in the SAMBA model, proposed in \cite{Tan02} for the analysis of microarray data, is $n^{\epsilon}$-inapproximable; and 2) no polynomial time algorithm exists for the Minimum Description Length with Holes problem \cite{Bu05} unless $\mathsf{RP=NP}$.
467|On line arrangements with applications to 3-nets|Giancarlo Urzua|We show a one-to-one correspondence between arrangements of d lines in the projective plane, and lines in P^{d-2}. We apply this correspondence to classify (3,q)-nets over the complex numbers for all q<=6. When q=6, we have twelve possible combinatorial cases, but we prove that only nine of them are realizable. This new case shows several new properties for 3-nets: different dimensions for moduli, strict realization over certain fields, etc. We also construct a three dimensional family of (3,8)-nets corresponding to the Quaternion group.
468|Testing turbulence model at metric scales with mid-infrared VISIR images   at the VLT|A. Tokovinin, M. Sarazin, A. Smette|We probe turbulence structure from centimetric to metric scales by simultaneous imagery at mid-infrared and visible wavelengths at the VLT telescope and show that it departs significantly from the commonly used Kolmogorov model. The data can be fitted by the von Karman model with an outer scale of the order of 30 m and we see clear signs of the phase structure function saturation across the 8-m VLT aperture. The image quality improves in the infrared faster than the standard lambda^{-1/5} scaling and may be diffraction-limited at 30-m apertures even without adaptive optics at wavelengths longer than 8 micron.
469|Density dependence of the symmetry energy and the nuclear equation of   state: A Dynamical and Statistical model perspective|D.V. Shetty, S.J. Yennello, and G.A. Souliotis|The density dependence of the symmetry energy in the equation of state of isospin asymmetric nuclear matter is of significant importance for studying the structure of systems as diverse as the neutron-rich nuclei and the neutron stars. A number of reactions using the dynamical and the statistical models of multifragmentation, and the experimental isoscaling observable, is studied to extract information on the density dependence of the symmetry energy. It is observed that the dynamical and the statistical model calculations give consistent results assuming the sequential decay effect in dynamical model to be small. A comparison with several other independent studies is also made to obtain important constraint on the form of the density dependence of the symmetry energy. The comparison rules out an extremely " stiff " and " soft " form of the density dependence of the symmetry energy with important implications for astrophysical and nuclear physics studies.
470|Competitive nucleation and the Ostwald rule in a generalized Potts model   with multiple metastable phases|David P. Sanders, Hern\'an Larralde, Fran\c{c}ois Leyvraz (Instituto   de Ciencias F\'isicas, Universidad Nacional Aut\'onoma de M\'exico)|We introduce a simple nearest-neighbor spin model with multiple metastable phases, the number and decay pathways of which are explicitly controlled by the parameters of the system. With this model we can construct, for example, a system which evolves through an arbitrarily long succession of metastable phases. We also construct systems in which different phases may nucleate competitively from a single initial phase. For such a system, we present a general method to extract from numerical simulations the individual nucleation rates of the nucleating phases. The results show that the Ostwald rule, which predicts which phase will nucleate, must be modified probabilistically when the new phases are almost equally stable. Finally, we show that the nucleation rate of a phase depends, among other things, on the number of other phases accessible from it.
471|Contrasting Two Transformation-Based Methods for Obtaining Absolute   Extrema|Delfim F. M. Torres, George Leitmann|In this note we contrast two transformation-based methods to deduce absolute extrema and the corresponding extremizers. Unlike variation-based methods, the transformation-based ones of Carlson and Leitmann and the recent one of Silva and Torres are direct in that they permit obtaining solutions by inspection.
472|Application of Ewald summations to long-range dispersion forces|Pieter J. in 't Veld, Ahmed E. Ismail, and Gary S. Grest|We present results illustrating the effects of using explicit summation terms for the $r^{-6}$ dispersion term on the interfacial properties of a Lennard-Jones fluid and SPC/E water. For the Lennard-Jones fluid, we find that the use of long-range summations, even with a short ``crossover radius,'' yields results that are consistent with simulations using large cutoff radii. Simulations of SPC/E water demonstrate that the long-range dispersion forces are of secondary importance to the Coulombic forces. In both cases, we find that the ratio of box size $L_{\parallel}$ to crossover radius $r_{\rm c}^{\mathbf k}$ plays an important role in determining the magnitude of the long-range dispersion correction, although its effect is secondary when Coulombic interactions are also present.
473|Possible non-thermal nature of the soft-excess emission in the cluster   of galaxies Sersic 159-03|N. Werner, J.S. Kaastra, Y. Takei, R. Lieu, J. Vink, T. Tamura|We present an analysis of new Suzaku data and archival data from XMM-Newton of the cluster of galaxies Sersic 159-03, which has a strong soft X-ray excess emission component. The Suzaku observation confirms the presence of the soft excess emission, but it does not confirm the presence of redshifted OVII lines in the cluster. Radial profiles and 2D maps derived from XMM-Newton observations show that the soft excess emission has a strong peak at the position of the central cD galaxy and the maps do not show any significant azimuthal variations. Although the soft excess emission can be fitted equally well with both thermal and non-thermal models, its spatial distribution is neither consistent with the models of intercluster warm-hot filaments, nor with models of clumpy warm intracluster gas associated with infalling groups. Using the data obtained by the XMM-Newton Reflection Grating Spectrometers we do not confirm the presence of the warm gas in the cluster centre with the expected properties assuming the soft excess is of thermal origin. The observed properties of the soft excess emission are consistent with the non-thermal interpretation. While the high density of relativistic electrons associated with the peak of the soft emission in the cluster centre might have been provided by an active galactic nucleus in the central cD galaxy, the underlying population might have been accelerated in diffuse shocks.
474|Geometric phase of an atom inside an adiabatic radio frequency potential|P. Zhang and L. You|We investigate the geometric phase of an atom inside an adiabatic radio frequency (rf) potential created from a static magnetic field (B-field) and a time dependent rf field. The spatial motion of the atomic center of mass is shown to give rise to a geometric phase, or Berry's phase, to the adiabatically evolving atomic hyperfine spin along the local B-field. This phase is found to depend on both the static B-field along the semi-classical trajectory of the atomic center of mass and an ``effective magnetic field'' of the total B-field, including the oscillating rf field. Specific calculations are provided for several recent atom interferometry experiments and proposals utilizing adiabatic rf potentials.
475|The Transition from the First Stars to the Second Stars in the Early   Universe|Britton D. Smith, Steinn Sigurdsson|We observe a sharp transition from a singular, high-mass mode of star formation, to a low-mass dominated mode, in numerical simulations, at a metallicity of 10^-3 Zsolar. We incorporate a new method for including the radiative cooling from metals into adaptive mesh-refinement hydrodynamic simulations. Our results illustrate how metals, produced by the first stars, led to a transition from the high-mass star formation mode of Pop III stars, to the low-mass mode that dominates today. We ran hydrodynamic simulations with cosmological initial conditions in the standard LambdaCDM model, with metallicities, from zero to 10^-2 Zsolar, beginnning at redshift, z = 99. The simulations were run until a dense core forms at the center of a 5 x 10^5 Msolar dark matter halo, at z ~ 18. Analysis of the central 1 Msolar core reveals that the two simulations with the lowest metallicities, Z = 0 and 10^-4 Zsolar, contain one clump with 99% of the mass, while the two with metallicities, Z = 10^-3 and 10^-2 Zsolar, each contain two clumps that share most of the mass. The Z = 10^-3 Zsolar simulation also produced two low-mass proto-stellar objects with masses between 10^-2 and 10^-1 Msolar. Gas with Z >= 10^-3 Zsolar is able to cool to the temperature of the CMB, which sets a lower limit to the minimum fragmentation mass. This suggests that the second generation stars produced a spectrum of lower mass stars, but were still more massive on average than stars formed in the local universe.
476|Super Star Cluster Velocity Dispersions and Virial Masses in the M82   Nuclear Starburst|Nate McCrady and James R. Graham|We use high-resolution near-infrared spectroscopy from Keck Observatory to measure the stellar velocity dispersions of 19 super star clusters (SSCs) in the nuclear starburst of M82. The clusters have ages on the order of 10 Myr, which is many times longer than the crossing times implied by their velocity dispersions and radii. We therefore apply the Virial Theorem to derive the kinematic mass for 15 of the SSCs. The SSCs have masses of 2 x 10^5 to 4 x 10^6 solar masses, with a total population mass of 1.4 x 10^7 solar masses. Comparison of the loci of the young M82 SSCs and old Milky Way globular clusters in a plot of radius versus velocity dispersion suggests that the SSCs are a population of potential globular clusters. We present the mass function for the SSCs, and find a power law fit with an index of gamma = -1.91 +/- 0.06. This result is nearly identical to the mass function of young SSCs in the Antennae galaxies.
477|The affine part of the Picard scheme|T.Geisser|We describe the maximal torus and maximal unipotent subgroup of the Picard variety of a proper scheme over a perfect field.
478|Enhanced quantum Zeno effect and bunching in the decay of interacting   bosons from an unstable state|Sungyun Kim, Artem Dudarev and Joachim Brand|paper withdrawn due to the possible error in numerical eigenfunction calculation
479|The few scales of nuclei and nuclear matter|A. Delfino, T. Frederico, V.S. Timoteo, Lauro Tomio|The well-known correlations of low-energy three and four-nucleon observables with a typical three-nucleon scale (e.g., the Tjon line) is extended to light nuclei and nuclear matter. Evidence for the scaling between light nuclei binding energies and the triton one are pointed out. We argue that the saturation energy and density of nuclear matter are correlated to the triton binding energy. The available systematic nuclear matter calculations indicate a possible band structure representing these correlations.
480|Implementation of holonomic quantum computation through engineering and   manipulating environment|Zhang-qi Yin, Fu-li Li, Peng Peng|We consider an atom-field coupled system, in which two pairs of four-level atoms are respectively driven by laser fields and trapped in two distant cavities that are connected by an optical fiber. First, we show that an effective squeezing reservoir can be engineered under appropriate conditions. Then, we show that a two-qubit geometric CPHASE gate between the atoms in the two cavities can be implemented through adiabatically manipulating the engineered reservoir along a closed loop. This scheme that combines engineering environment with decoherence-free space and geometric phase quantum computation together has the remarkable feature: a CPHASE gate with arbitrary phase shift is implemented by simply changing the strength and relative phase of the driving fields.
481|Vortex state in a Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov superconductor based   on the quasiclassical theory|Masanori Ichioka, Hiroto Adachi, Takeshi Mizushima, Kazushige Machida|We investigate the vortex state with Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) modulations suggested for a high field phase of CeCoIn_5. On the basis of the quasiclassical Eilenberger theory, we calculate the three dimensional structure of pair potentials, internal magnetic fields, paramagnetic moments, and electronic states, for the s-wave and the d-wave pairings comparatively. The \pi-phase shift of the pair potential at the FFLO nodal plane or at the vortex core induces sharp peak states in the local density of states, and enhances the local paramagnetic moment. We also discuss the NMR spectrum and the neutron scattering as methods to detect the FFLO structure.
482|Search for Chaotic Behavior in a Flapping Flag|J. O. McCaslin and P. R. Broussard|We measured the correlation of the times between successive flaps of a flag for a variety of wind speeds and found no evidence of low dimensional chaotic behavior in the return maps of these times. We instead observed what is best modeled as random times determined by an exponential distribution. This study was done as an undergraduate experiment and illustrates the differences between low dimensional chaotic and possibly higher dimensional chaotic systems.
483|Optimal Shape Design for Stokes Flow Via Minimax Differentiability|Z.M. Gao, Y.C. Ma, H.W. Zhuang|This paper is concerned with a shape sensitivity analysis of a viscous incompressible fluid driven by Stokes equations with nonhomogeneous boundary condition. The structure of shape gradient with respect to the shape of the variable domain for a given cost function is established by using the differentiability of a minimax formulation involving a Lagrangian functional combining with function space parametrization technique or function space embedding technique. We apply an gradient type algorithm to our problem. Numerical examples show that our theory is useful for practical purpose and the proposed algorithm is feasible.
484|Kinematic Decoupling of Globular Clusters with Extended   Horizontal-Branch|Young-Wook Lee, Hansung B. Gim, Dana I. Casetti-Dinescu|About 25% of the Milky Way globular clusters (GCs) exhibit unusually extended color distribution of stars in the horizontal-branch (HB) phase. This phenomenon is now best understood as due to the presence of helium enhanced second generation subpopulations, which has raised a possibility that these peculiar GCs might have a unique origin. Here we show that these GCs with extended HB are clearly distinct from other normal GCs in kinematics and mass. The GCs with extended HB are more massive than normal GCs, and are dominated by random motion with no correlation between kinematics and metallicity. Surprisingly, however, when they are excluded, most normal GCs in the inner halo show clear signs of dissipational collapse that apparently led to the formation of the disk. Normal GCs in the outer halo share their kinematic properties with the extended HB GCs, which is consistent with the accretion origin. Our result further suggests heterogeneous origins of GCs, and we anticipate this to be a starting point for more detailed investigations of Milky Way formation, including early mergers, collapse, and later accretion.
485|Scalar potential model progress|J. C. Hodge|Because observations of galaxies and clusters have been found inconsistent with General Relativity (GR), the focus of effort in developing a Scalar Potential Model (SPM) has been on the examination of galaxies and clusters. The SPM has been found to be consistent with cluster cellular structure, the flow of IGM from spiral galaxies to elliptical galaxies, intergalactic redshift without an expanding universe, discrete redshift, rotation curve (RC) data without dark matter, asymmetric RCs, galaxy central mass, galaxy central velocity dispersion, and the Pioneer Anomaly. In addition, the SPM suggests a model of past expansion, past contraction, and current expansion of the universe. GR corresponds to the SPM in the limit in which the effect of the Sources and Sinks approximate a flat scalar potential field such as between clusters and on the solar system scale, which is small relative to the distance to a Source.
486|Teleparallel Version of the Stationary Axisymmetric Solutions and their   Energy Contents|M. Sharif and M. Jamil Amir|This work contains the teleparallel version of the stationary axisymmetric solutions. We obtain the tetrad and the torsion fields representing these solutions. The tensor, vector and axial-vector parts of the torsion tensor are evaluated. It is found that the axial-vector has component only along $\rho$ and $z$ directions. The three possibilities of the axial vector depending on the metric function $B$ are discussed. The vector related with spin has also been evaluated and the corresponding extra Hamiltonian is furnished. Further, we use the teleparallel version of M$\ddot{o}$ller prescription to find the energy-momentum distribution of the solutions. It is interesting to note that (for $\lambda=1$) energy and momentum densities in teleparallel theory are equal to the corresponding quantities in GR plus an additional quantity in each, which may become equal under certain conditions. Finally, we discuss the two special cases of the stationary axisymmetric solutions.
487|Relativistic treatment in D-dimensions to a spin-zero particle with   noncentral equal scalar and vector ring-shaped Kratzer potential|Sameer M. Ikhdair, Ramazan Sever|The Klein-Gordon equation in D-dimensions for a recently proposed Kratzer potential plus ring-shaped potential is solved analytically by means of the conventional Nikiforov-Uvarov method. The exact energy bound-states and the corresponding wave functions of the Klein-Gordon are obtained in the presence of the noncentral equal scalar and vector potentials. The results obtained in this work are more general and can be reduced to the standard forms in three-dimensions given by other works.
488|Long Distance Signaling Using Axion-like Particles|Daniel D. Stancil|The possible existence of axion-like particles could lead to a new type of long distance communication. In this work, basic antenna concepts are defined and a Friis-like equation is derived to facilitate long-distance link calculations. An example calculation is presented showing that communication over distances of 1000 km or more may be possible for $m_{a}< 3.5$ meV and $g_{a\gamma \gamma} > 5 \times 10^{- 8} {\text{GeV}}^{- 1}$.
489|Weighted percolation on directed networks|Juan G. Restrepo, Edward Ott, Brian R. Hunt|We present an analysis of the percolation transition for general node removal strategies valid for locally tree-like directed networks. On the basis of heuristic arguments we predict that, if the probability of removing node $i$ is $p_i$, the network disintegrates if $p_i$ is such that the largest eigenvalue of the matrix with entries $A_{ij}(1-p_i)$ is less than 1, where $A$ is the adjacency matrix of the network. The knowledge or applicability of a Markov network model is not required by our theory, thus making it applicable to situations not covered by previous works. We test our predicted percolation criterion against numerical results for different networks and node removal strategies.
490|Refuting the Pseudo Attack on the REESSE1+ Cryptosystem|Shenghui Su, and Shuwang Lu|We illustrate through example 1 and 2 that the condition at theorem 1 in [8] dissatisfies necessity, and the converse proposition of fact 1.1 in [8] does not hold, namely the condition Z/M - L/Ak < 1/(2 Ak^2) is not sufficient for f(i) + f(j) = f(k). Illuminate through an analysis and ex.3 that there is a logic error during deduction of fact 1.2, which causes each of fact 1.2, 1.3, 4 to be invalid. Demonstrate through ex.4 and 5 that each or the combination of qu+1 > qu * D at fact 4 and table 1 at fact 2.2 is not sufficient for f(i) + f(j) = f(k), property 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 each are invalid, and alg.1 based on fact 4 and alg.2 based on table 1 are disordered and wrong logically. Further, manifest through a repeated experiment and ex.5 that the data at table 2 is falsified, and the example in [8] is woven elaborately. We explain why Cx = Ax * W^f(x) (% M) is changed to Cx = (Ax * W^f(x))^d (% M) in REESSE1+ v2.1. To the signature fraud, we point out that [8] misunderstands the existence of T^-1 and Q^-1 % (M-1), and forging of Q can be easily avoided through moving H. Therefore, the conclusion of [8] that REESSE1+ is not secure at all (which connotes that [8] can extract a related private key from any public key in REESSE1+) is fully incorrect, and as long as the parameter Omega is fitly selected, REESSE1+ with Cx = Ax * W^f(x) (% M) is secure.
491|Phase structure of a surface model on dynamically triangulated spheres   with elastic skeletons|Hiroshi Koibuchi|We find three distinct phases; a tubular phase, a planar phase, and the spherical phase, in a triangulated fluid surface model. It is also found that these phases are separated by discontinuous transitions. The fluid surface model is investigated within the framework of the conventional curvature model by using the canonical Monte Carlo simulations with dynamical triangulations. The mechanical strength of the surface is given only by skeletons, and no two-dimensional bending energy is assumed in the Hamiltonian. The skeletons are composed of elastic linear-chains and rigid junctions and form a compartmentalized structure on the surface, and for this reason the vertices of triangles can diffuse freely only inside the compartments. As a consequence, an inhomogeneous structure is introduced in the model; the surface strength inside the compartments is different from the surface strength on the compartments. However, the rotational symmetry is not influenced by the elastic skeletons; there is no specific direction on the surface. In addition to the three phases mentioned above, a collapsed phase is expected to exist in the low bending rigidity regime that was not studied here. The inhomogeneous structure and the fluidity of vertices are considered to be the origin of such variety of phases.
492|Vortex Dynamics at the Initial Stage of Resistive Transition in   Superconductors with Fractal Cluster Structure|Yuriy I. Kuzmin|The effect of fractal normal-phase clusters on vortex dynamics in a percolative superconductor is considered. The superconductor contains percolative superconducting cluster carrying a transport current and clusters of a normal phase, acting as pinning centers. A prototype of such a structure is YBCO film, containing clusters of columnar defects, as well as the BSCCO/Ag sheathed tape, which is of practical interest for wire fabrication. Transition of the superconductor into a resistive state corresponds to the percolation transition from a pinned vortex state to a resistive state when the vortices are free to move. The dependencies of the free vortex density on the fractal dimension of the cluster boundary as well as the resistance on the transport current are obtained. It is revealed that a mixed state of the vortex glass type is realized in the superconducting system involved. The current-voltage characteristics of superconductors containing fractal clusters are obtained and their features are studied.
493|The Veldkamp Space of Two-Qubits|Metod Saniga (ASTRINSTSAV), Michel Planat (FEMTO-ST), Petr Pracna   (JH-Inst), Hans Havlicek (TUW)|Given a remarkable representation of the generalized Pauli operators of two-qubits in terms of the points of the generalized quadrangle of order two, W(2), it is shown that specific subsets of these operators can also be associated with the points and lines of the four-dimensional projective space over the Galois field with two elements - the so-called Veldkamp space of W(2). An intriguing novelty is the recognition of (uni- and tri-centric) triads and specific pentads of the Pauli operators in addition to the "classical" subsets answering to geometric hyperplanes of W(2).
494|Fusion process studied with preequilibrium giant dipole resonance in   time dependent Hartree-Fock theory|C\'edric Simenel (SPhN, GANIL), Philippe Chomaz (GANIL), Gilles De   France (GANIL)|The equilibration of macroscopic degrees of freedom during the fusion of heavy nuclei, like the charge and the shape, are studied in the Time-Dependent Hartree-Fock theory. The pre-equilibrium Giant Dipole Resonance (GDR) is used to probe the fusion path. It is shown that such isovector collective state is excited in N/Z asymmetric fusion and to a less extent in mass asymmetric systems. The characteristics of this GDR are governed by the structure of the fused system in its preequilibrium phase, like its deformation, rotation and vibration. In particular, we show that a lowering of the pre-equilibrium GDR energy is expected as compared to the statistical one. Revisiting experimental data, we extract an evidence of this lowering for the first time. We also quantify the fusion-evaporation enhancement due to gamma-ray emission from the pre-equilibrium GDR. This cooling mechanism along the fusion path may be suitable to synthesize in the future super heavy elements using radioactive beams with strong N/Z asymmetries in the entrance channel.
495|Penalization approach for mixed hyperbolic systems with constant   coefficients satisfying a Uniform Lopatinski Condition|Bruno Fornet (LATP, LMRS)|In this paper, we describe a new, systematic and explicit way of approximating solutions of mixed hyperbolic systems with constant coefficients satisfying a Uniform Lopatinski Condition via different Penalization approaches.
496|A unified analysis of the reactor neutrino program towards the   measurement of the theta_13 mixing angle|Guillaume Mention (DAPNIA), Thierry Lasserre (DAPNIA, APC), Dario   Motta (DAPNIA)|We present in this article a detailed quantitative discussion of the measurement of the leptonic mixing angle theta_13 through currently scheduled reactor neutrino oscillation experiments. We thus focus on Double Chooz (Phase I & II), Daya Bay (Phase I & II) and RENO experiments. We perform a unified analysis, including systematics, backgrounds and accurate experimental setup in each case. Each identified systematic error and background impact has been assessed on experimental setups following published data when available and extrapolating from Double Chooz acquired knowledge otherwise. After reviewing the experiments, we present a new analysis of their sensitivities to sin^2(2 theta_13) and study the impact of the different systematics based on the pulls approach. Through this generic statistical analysis we discuss the advantages and drawbacks of each experimental setup.
497|Optimal Routing for Decode-and-Forward based Cooperation in Wireless   Networks|Lawrence Ong and Mehul Motani|We investigate cooperative wireless relay networks in which the nodes can help each other in data transmission. We study different coding strategies in the single-source single-destination network with many relay nodes. Given the myriad of ways in which nodes can cooperate, there is a natural routing problem, i.e., determining an ordered set of nodes to relay the data from the source to the destination. We find that for a given route, the decode-and-forward strategy, which is an information theoretic cooperative coding strategy, achieves rates significantly higher than that achievable by the usual multi-hop coding strategy, which is a point-to-point non-cooperative coding strategy. We construct an algorithm to find an optimal route (in terms of rate maximizing) for the decode-and-forward strategy. Since the algorithm runs in factorial time in the worst case, we propose a heuristic algorithm that runs in polynomial time. The heuristic algorithm outputs an optimal route when the nodes transmit independent codewords. We implement these coding strategies using practical low density parity check codes to compare the performance of the strategies on different routes.

499|On universality of critical behaviour in the focusing nonlinear   Schr\"odinger equation, elliptic umbilic catastrophe and the {\it   tritronqu\'ee} solution to the Painlev\'e-I equation|B.Dubrovin, T.Grava, C.Klein|We argue that the critical behaviour near the point of ``gradient catastrophe" of the solution to the Cauchy problem for the focusing nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation $ i\epsilon \psi_t +\frac{\epsilon^2}2\psi_{xx}+ \psi^2 \psi =0$ with analytic initial data of the form $\psi(x,0;\epsilon) =A(x) e^{\frac{i}{\epsilon} S(x)}$ is approximately described by a particular solution to the Painlev\'e-I equation.
500|Generic representations of orthogonal groups: projective functors in the   category Fquad|Christine Vespa|In this paper, we continue the study of the category of functors Fquad, associated to F_2-vector spaces equipped with a nondegenerate quadratic form, initiated in two previous papers of the author. We define a filtration of the standard projective objects in Fquad; this refines to give a decomposition into indecomposable factors of the two first standard projective objects in Fquad. As an application of these two decompositions, we give a complete description of the polynomial functors of the category Fquad.
